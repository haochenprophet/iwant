1. Introduction

There is a need for standard mechanisms to patch datastores defined in [RFC6241], which contain conceptual data that conforms to schema specified with YANG [RFC7950]. An "ordered edit list" approach is needed to provide RESTCONF client developers with more precise RESTCONF client control of the edit procedure than existing mechanisms found in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].

This document defines a media type for a YANG-based editing mechanism that can be used with the HTTP PATCH method [RFC5789]. YANG Patch is designed to support the RESTCONF protocol, defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]. This document only specifies the use of the YANG Patch media type with the RESTCONF protocol.

It may be possible to use YANG Patch with other protocols besides RESTCONF. This is outside the scope of this document. For any protocol which supports the YANG Patch media type, if the entire patch document cannot be successfully applied, then the server MUST NOT apply any of the changes. It may be possible to use YANG Patch with datastore types other than a configuration datastore. This is outside the scope of this document.

1.1 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.1 NETCONF

The following terms are defined in [RFC6241]:

configuration data
datastore
configuration datastore
protocol operation
running configuration datastore
state data
user
1.1.2 HTTP

The following terms are defined in [RFC7230]:

header field
message-body
query
request URI
The following terms are defined in [RFC7231]:

method
request
resource
1.1.3 YANG

The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

container
data node
leaf
leaf-list
list
RPC operation (now called protocol operation)
1.1.4 RESTCONF

The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]:

application/yang-data+xml
application/yang-data+json
data resource
datastore resource
patch
RESTCONF capability
target resource
YANG data template
1.1.5 YANG Patch

The following terms are used within this document:

RESTCONF client: a client which implements the RESTCONF protocol.
RESTCONF server: a server which implements the RESTCONF protocol.
YANG Patch: a conceptual edit request using the "yang‑patch" YANG Patch template, defined in Section 3. In HTTP, refers to a PATCH method where a representation uses either the media type "application/yang‑patch+xml" or "application/yang‑patch+json".
YANG Patch Status: a conceptual edit status response using the YANG "yang‑patch‑status" YANG data template, defined in Section 3. In HTTP, refers to a response message for a PATCH method, where it has a representation with either the media type "application/yang‑data+xml" or "application/yang‑data+json".
YANG Patch template: this is similar to a YANG data template, except it has a representation with the media type "application/yang‑patch+xml" or "application/yang‑patch+json".
1.1.6 Examples

Some protocol message lines within examples throughout the document are split into multiple lines for display purposes only. When a line ends with backslash ('\') as the last character, the line is wrapped for display purposes. It is to be considered to be joined to the next line by deleting the backslash, the following line break, and the leading whitespace of the next line.

1.1.7 Tree Diagram Notations

A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in this document. The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.
Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration data (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only), and "x" operation resource (executable)
Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*" denotes a "list" and "leaf‑list".
Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also marked with a colon (":").
Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not shown.
2. YANG Patch

A "YANG Patch" is an ordered list of edits that are applied to the target datastore by the RESTCONF server. The specific fields are defined in the YANG module in Section 3.

The YANG Patch operation is invoked by the RESTCONF client by sending a PATCH method request with a representation using either the "application/yang‑patch+xml" or "application/yang‑patch+json" media type. This message-body representing the YANG Patch input parameters MUST be present.

YANG Patch has some features that are not possible with the PATCH method in RESTCONF:

YANG Patch allows multiple sub-resources to be edited within the same PATCH method.
YANG Patch allows more precise edit operations than RESTCONF. There are 7 operations supported (create, delete, insert, merge, move, replace, remove).
YANG Patch uses an edit list with an explicit processing order. The edits are processed in client-specified order, and error processing can be precise even when multiple errors occur in the same patch request.
The YANG Patch "patch‑id" may be useful for debugging, and SHOULD be present in any audit audit logging records generated by the RESTCONF server for a patch.

The RESTCONF server MUST return the Accept-Patch header field in an OPTIONS response, as specified in [RFC5789], which includes the media type for YANG Patch. This is needed by a client to determine the message encoding formats supported by the server (e.g., XML, JSON, or both). An example is shown in Figure 1.

  Accept-Patch: application/yang-patch+xml,application/yang-patch+json


               Figure 1: Example Accept-Patch header
	    
Note that YANG Patch can only edit data resources. The PATCH method cannot be used to replace the datastore resource. Although the "ietf‑yang‑patch" YANG module is written using YANG version 1.1 [RFC7950], an implementation of YANG Patch can be used with content defined in YANG version 1 [RFC6020] as well.

A YANG Patch can be encoded in XML format according to [W3C.REC-xml-20081126]. It can also be encoded in JSON, according to "JSON Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG" [RFC7951]. If any meta-data needs to be sent in a JSON message, it is encoded according to "Defining and Using Metadata with YANG" [RFC7952].

2.1 Target Resource

The YANG Patch operation uses the RESTCONF target resource URI to identify the resource that will be patched. This can be the datastore resource itself, i.e., "{+restconf}/data", to edit top-level configuration data resources, or it can be a configuration data resource within the datastore resource, e.g., "{+restconf}/data/ietf‑interfaces:interfaces", to edit sub-resources within a top-level configuration data resource.

The target resource MUST identify exactly one resource instance. If more than one resource instance is identified, then the request MUST NOT be processed, and a "400 Bad Request" error response MUST be sent by the server. If the target resource does not identify any existing resource instance then the request MUST NOT be processed, and a "404 Not Found" error response MUST be sent by the server.

Each edit with a YANG Patch identifies a target data node for the associated edit. This is described in Section 2.4.

2.2 yang-patch Request

A YANG patch is optionally identified by a unique "patch‑id" and it may have an optional comment. A patch is an ordered collection of edits. Each edit is identified by an "edit‑id" and it has an edit operation (create, delete, insert, merge, move, replace, remove) that is applied to the target resource. Each edit can be applied to a sub-resource "target" within the target resource. If the operation is "insert" or "move", then the "where" parameter indicates how the node is inserted or moved. For values "before" and "after", the "point" parameter specifies the data node insertion point.

The merge, replace, create, delete, and remove edit operations have the exact same meaning as defined for the "operation" attribute in section 7.2 of [RFC6241].

Each edit within a YANG Patch MUST identify exactly one data resource instance. If an edit represents more than one resource instance, then the request MUST NOT be processed, and a "400 Bad Request" error response MUST be sent by the server. If the edit does not identify any existing resource instance, and the operation for the edit is not "create", then the request MUST NOT be processed, and a "404 Not Found" error response MUST be sent by the server. A "yang‑patch‑status" response MUST be sent by the server identifying the edit(s) that are not valid.

YANG Patch does not provide any access to specific datastores. It is an implementation detail how a server processes an edit if it is co-located with a NETCONF server that does provide access to individual datastores. A complete datastore cannot be replaced in the same manner as provided by the "copy‑config" operation defined in section 7.3 of [RFC6241]. Only the specified nodes in a YANG Patch are affected.

A message-body representing the YANG Patch is sent by the RESTCONF client to specify the edit operation request. When used with the HTTP PATCH method, this data is identified by the YANG Patch media type.

        +---- patch-id    string
        +---- comment?    string
        +---- edit* [edit-id]

           +---- where?       enumeration
           +---- value?
	    
2.3 yang-patch-status Response

A message-body representing the YANG Patch Status is returned to the RESTCONF client to report the detailed status of the edit operation. When used with the HTTP PATCH method, this data is identified by the YANG Patch Status media type, and the syntax specification is defined in Section 3.

        |  +--:(ok)
        |     +---- ok?            empty
        +---- edit-status
           +---- edit* [edit-id]
              +---- edit-id    string
              +---- (edit-status-choice)?
                 +--:(ok)
                 |  +---- ok?        empty
                 +--:(errors)
                    +---- errors
                       +---- error*
                          +---- error-type       enumeration
                          +---- error-tag        string
                          +---- error-app-tag?   string
                          +---- error-path?      instance-identifier
                          +---- error-message?   string
                          +---- error-info?
	    
2.4 Target Data Node

The target data node for each edit operation is determined by the value of the target resource in the request and the "target" leaf within each "edit" entry.

If the target resource specified in the request URI identifies a datastore resource, then the path string in the "target" leaf is treated as an absolute path expression identifying the target data node for the corresponding edit. The first node specified in the "target" leaf is a top-level data node defined within a YANG module. The "target" leaf MUST NOT contain a single forward slash "/", since this would identify the datastore resource, not a data resource.

If the target resource specified in the request URI identifies a configuration data resource, then the path string in the "target" leaf is treated as a relative path expression. The first node specified in the "target" leaf is a child configuration data node of the data node associated with the target resource. If the "target" leaf contains a single forward slash "/", then the target data node is the target resource data node.

2.5 Edit Operations

Each YANG patch edit specifies one edit operation on the target data node. The set of operations is aligned with the NETCONF edit operations, but also includes some new operations.

YANG Patch Edit Operations
Operation	Description
create	create a new data resource if it does not already exist or error
delete	delete a data resource if it already exists or error
insert	insert a new user-ordered data resource
merge	merge the edit value with the target data resource; create if it does not already exist
move	re-order the target data resource
replace	replace the target data resource with the edit value
remove	remove a data resource if it already exists
2.6 Successful Edit Response Handling

If a YANG Patch is completed without errors, the RESTCONF server MUST return a "yang‑patch‑status" message with a global-status choice set to 'ok'.

The RESTCONF server will save the running datastore to non-volatile storage if it supports non-volatile storage, and if the running datastore contents have changed, as specified in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].

Refer to Appendix D.1.2 for a example of a successful YANG Patch response.

2.7 Error Handling

If a well-formed, schema-valid YANG Patch message is received, then the RESTCONF server will process the supplied edits in ascending order. The following error modes apply to the processing of this edit list:

If a YANG Patch is completed with errors, the RESTCONF server SHOULD return a "yang‑patch‑status" message. It is possible (e.g., within a distributed implementation), that an invalid request will be rejected before the YANG patch edits are processed. In this case, the server MUST send the appropriate HTTP error response instead.

Refer to Appendix D.1.1 for a example of an error YANG Patch response.

2.8 yang-patch RESTCONF Capability

A URI is defined to identify the YANG Patch extension to the base RESTCONF protocol. If the RESTCONF server supports the YANG Patch media type, then the "yang‑patch" RESTCONF capability defined in Section 4.3 MUST be present in the "capability" leaf-list in the "ietf‑restconf‑monitoring" module defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].

3. YANG Module

The "ietf‑yang‑patch" module defines conceptual definitions with the 'yang‑data' extension statements, which are not meant to be implemented as datastore contents by a RESTCONF server.

The "ietf‑restconf" module from [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] is used by this module for the 'yang‑data' extension definition.

5. Security Considerations

The YANG Patch media type does not introduce any significant new security threats, beyond what is described in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]. This document defines edit processing instructions for a variant of the PATCH method, as used within the RESTCONF protocol.

It may be possible to use YANG Patch with other protocols besides RESTCONF, which is outside the scope of this document.

For RESTCONF, both the client and server MUST be authenticated, according to section 2 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]. It is important for RESTCONF server implementations to carefully validate all the edit request parameters in some manner. If the entire YANG Patch request cannot be completed, then no configuration changes to the system are done. A PATCH request MUST be applied atomically, as specified in section 2 of [RFC5789].

A RESTCONF server implementation SHOULD attempt to prevent system disruption due to incremental processing of the YANG Patch edit list. It may be possible to construct an attack on such a RESTCONF server, which relies on the edit processing order mandated by YANG Patch. A server SHOULD apply only the fully validated configuration to the underlying system. For example, an edit list which deleted an interface and then recreated it could cause system disruption if the edit list was incrementally applied.

A RESTCONF server implementation SHOULD attempt to prevent system disruption due to excessive resource consumption required to fulfill YANG Patch edit requests. It may be possible to construct an attack on such a RESTCONF server, which attempts to consume all available memory or other resource types.

Removed open issue 'RESTCONF coupling' because there is no concern about a normative reference to RESTCONF. There may need to be a YANG 1.1 mechanism to allow protocol template usage (instead of grouping wrapper).
Removed open issue 'Is the delete operation needed'. It was decided that both delete and remove should remain as operations and clients can choose which one to use. This is not an implementation burden on the server.
Removed open issue 'global-errors needed'. It was decided that they are needed as defined because the global <ok/> is needed and the special key value for edit=global error only allows for 1 global error.
Removed open issue 'Is location leaf needed'. It was decided that it is not needed so this leaf has been removed.
Removed open issue 'Bulk editing support in yang-patch-status'. The 'location' leaf has been removed so this issue is no longer applicable.
Removed open issue 'Edit list mechanism'. Added text to the 'edit' list description-stmt about how the individual edits must be processed. There is no concern about duplicate edits which cause intermediate results to be altered by subsequent edits in the same edit list.

D.1 YANG Patch Examples

This section includes RESTCONF examples. Most examples are shown in JSON encoding [RFC7159], and some are shown in XML encoding [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].

D.1.1 Add Resources: Error

The following example shows several songs being added to an existing album. Each edit contains one song. The first song already exists, so an error will be reported for that edit. The rest of the edits were not attempted, since the first edit failed. The XML encoding is used in this example.
