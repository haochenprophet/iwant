ode>make</code></h2>

<p>The <code>make</code> utility automatically determines which pieces of a=
 large
program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
This manual describes GNU <code>make</code>, which was implemented by Richa=
rd
Stallman and Roland McGrath.  Development since Version 3.76 has been
handled by Paul D. Smith.
</p>
<p>GNU <code>make</code> conforms to section 6.2 of <cite>IEEE Standard
1003.2-1992</cite> (POSIX.2).

<span id=3D"index-IEEE-Standard-1003_002e2"></span>
<span id=3D"index-standards-conformance"></span>
</p>
<p>Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can us=
e
<code>make</code> with any programming language whose compiler can be run w=
ith a
shell command.  Indeed, <code>make</code> is not limited to programs.  You =
can
use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically
from others whenever the others change.

ing and Running Make</h3>

<p>To prepare to use <code>make</code>, you must write a file called
the <em>makefile</em> that describes the relationships among files
in your program and provides commands for updating each file.
In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object
files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.
</p>
<p>Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">make
</pre></div>

<p>suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <code>make</code>=
 program
uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to
decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those files, it
issues the recipes recorded in the data base.
</p>
<p>You can provide command line arguments to <code>make</code> to control w=
hich
files should be recompiled, or how.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/sof=
tware/make/manual/make.html#Running">How to Run
<code>make</code></a>.

<p>If you have problems with GNU <code>make</code> or think you=E2=80=99ve =
found a bug,
please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything but
we might well want to fix it.
</p>
<p>Before reporting a bug, make sure you=E2=80=99ve actually found a real b=
ug.
Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
what you=E2=80=99re trying to do.  If it=E2=80=99s not clear whether you sh=
ould be able
to do something or not, report that too; it=E2=80=99s a bug in the
documentation!
</p>
<p>Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible makefile that reproduces the problem.  Then
send us the makefile and the exact results <code>make</code> gave you,
including any error or warning messages.  Please don=E2=80=99t paraphrase
these messages: it=E2=80=99s best to cut and paste them into your report.
When generating this small makefile, be sure to not use any non-free
or unusual tools in your recipes: you can almost always emulate what
such a tool would do with simple shell commands.  Finally, be sure to
explain what you expected to occur; this will help us decide whether
the problem was really in the documentation.
</p>
<p>Once you have a precise problem you can report it in one of two ways.
Either send electronic mail to:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">    bug-make@gnu.org
</pre></div>

<p>or use our Web-based project management tool, at:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">    https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/
</pre></div>

<p>In addition to the information above, please be careful to include the
version number of <code>make</code> you are using.  You can get this
information with the command =E2=80=98<samp>make --version</samp>=E2=80=99.=
  Be sure also to
include the type of machine and operating system you are using.  One
way to obtain this information is by looking at the final lines of
output from the command =E2=80=98<samp>make --help</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>If you have a code change you=E2=80=99d like to submit, see the <samp>RE=
ADME</samp> file
section =E2=80=9CSubmitting Patches=E2=80=9D for information.

<span id=3D"An-Introduction-to-Makefiles"></span><h2 class=3D"chapter">2 An=
 Introduction to Makefiles</h2>

<p>You need a file called a <em>makefile</em> to tell <code>make</code> wha=
t to do.
Most often, the makefile tells <code>make</code> how to compile and link a
program.
<span id=3D"index-makefile"></span>
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss a simple makefile that describes how to
compile and link a text editor which consists of eight C source files
and three header files.  The makefile can also tell <code>make</code> how t=
o
run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove
certain files as a clean-up operation).  To see a more complex example
of a makefile, see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make=
.html#Complex-Makefile">Complex Makefile Example</a>.
</p>
<p>When <code>make</code> recompiles the editor, each changed C source file
must be recompiled.  If a header file has changed, each C source file
that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe.  Each
compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.
Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files,
whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked
together to produce the new executable editor.

 Rule Looks Like</h3>

<span id=3D"index-makefile-rule-parts"></span>
<span id=3D"index-parts-of-makefile-rule"></span>

<p>A simple makefile consists of =E2=80=9Crules=E2=80=9D with the following=
 shape:
</p>
<span id=3D"index-targets_002c-introduction-to"></span>
<span id=3D"index-prerequisites_002c-introduction-to"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recipes_002c-introduction-to"></span>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>target</var> =E2=80=A6 : <var>prerequisites</va=
r> =E2=80=A6
        <var>recipe</var>
        =E2=80=A6
        =E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p>A <em>target</em> is usually the name of a file that is generated by a
program; examples of targets are executable or object files.  A target
can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as =E2=80=98<samp>clea=
n</samp>=E2=80=99
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Phony-Ta=
rgets">Phony Targets</a>).
</p>
<p>A <em>prerequisite</em> is a file that is used as input to create the
target.  A target often depends on several files.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-tabs-in-rules"></span>
<p>A <em>recipe</em> is an action that <code>make</code> carries out.  A re=
cipe
may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its
own line.  <strong>Please note:</strong> you need to put a tab character at
the beginning of every recipe line!  This is an obscurity that catches
the unwary.  If you prefer to prefix your recipes with a character
other than tab, you can set the <code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable to an
alternate character (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manua=
l/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Special Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>Usually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a
target file if any of the prerequisites change.  However, the rule that
specifies a recipe for the target need not have prerequisites.  For
example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the
target =E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=99 does not have prerequisites.
</p>
<p>A <em>rule</em>, then, explains how and when to remake certain files
which are the targets of the particular rule.  <code>make</code> carries ou=
t
the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target.  A
rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rules">Wr=
iting Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>A makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile
need only contain rules.  Rules may look somewhat more complicated
than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more or less.

<p>To use this makefile to create the executable file called <samp>edit</sa=
mp>,
type:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">make
</pre></div>

<p>To use this makefile to delete the executable file and all the object
files from the directory, type:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">make clean
</pre></div>

<p>In the example makefile, the targets include the executable file
=E2=80=98<samp>edit</samp>=E2=80=99, and the object files =E2=80=98<samp>ma=
in.o</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>kbd.o</samp>=E2=80=99.  The
prerequisites are files such as =E2=80=98<samp>main.c</samp>=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98<samp>defs.h</samp>=E2=80=99.
In fact, each =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 file is both a target and a=
 prerequisite.
Recipes include =E2=80=98<samp>cc&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebreak">-c</span=
>&nbsp;main.c</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> and =E2=80=98<samp>cc&nbsp;<span =
class=3D"nolinebreak">-c</span>&nbsp;kbd.c</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->.
</p>
<p>When a target is a file, it needs to be recompiled or relinked if any
of its prerequisites change.  In addition, any prerequisites that are
themselves automatically generated should be updated first.  In this
example, <samp>edit</samp> depends on each of the eight object files; the
object file <samp>main.o</samp> depends on the source file <samp>main.c</sa=
mp> and
on the header file <samp>defs.h</samp>.
</p>
<p>A recipe may follow each line that contains a target and
prerequisites.  These recipes say how to update the target file.  A
tab character (or whatever character is specified by the
<code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/sof=
tware/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Special Variables</a>)=
 must come at
the beginning of every line in the recipe to distinguish recipes from
other lines in the makefile.  (Bear in mind that <code>make</code> does not
know anything about how the recipes work.  It is up to you to supply
recipes that will update the target file properly.  All <code>make</code>
does is execute the recipe you have specified when the target file
needs to be updated.)
<span id=3D"index-recipe"></span>
</p>
<p>The target =E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=99 is not a file, but merel=
y the name of an
action.  Since you normally do not want to carry out the actions in
this rule, =E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=99 is not a prerequisite of an=
y other rule.
Consequently, <code>make</code> never does anything with it unless you tell
it specifically.  Note that this rule not only is not a prerequisite,
it also does not have any prerequisites, so the only purpose of the
rule is to run the specified recipe.  Targets that do not refer to
files but are just actions are called <em>phony targets</em>.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Phony-Tar=
gets">Phony Targets</a>, for information about this kind of target.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Errors">E=
rrors in Recipes</a>, to see how to cause <code>make</code>
to ignore errors from <code>rm</code> or any other command.

 How <code>make</code> Processes a Makefile</h3>
<span id=3D"index-processing-a-makefile"></span>
<span id=3D"index-makefile_002c-how-make-processes"></span>

<p>By default, <code>make</code> starts with the first target (not targets =
whose names
start with =E2=80=98<samp>.</samp>=E2=80=99 unless they also contain one or=
 more =E2=80=98<samp>/</samp>=E2=80=99).  This is
called the <em>default goal</em>.  (<em>Goals</em> are the targets that <co=
de>make</code>
strives ultimately to update.  You can override this behavior using the
command line (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.=
html#Goals">Arguments to Specify the Goals</a>) or with the
<code>.DEFAULT_GOAL</code> special variable (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu=
.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other
Special Variables</a>).
<span id=3D"index-default-goal"></span>
<span id=3D"index-goal_002c-default"></span>
<span id=3D"index-goal"></span>
</p>
<p>In the simple example of the previous section, the default goal is to
update the executable program <samp>edit</samp>; therefore, we put that rul=
e
first.
</p>
<p>Thus, when you give the command:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">make
</pre></div>

<p><code>make</code> reads the makefile in the current directory and begins=
 by
processing the first rule.  In the example, this rule is for relinking
<samp>edit</samp>; but before <code>make</code> can fully process this rule=
, it
must process the rules for the files that <samp>edit</samp> depends on,
which in this case are the object files.  Each of these files is
processed according to its own rule.  These rules say to update each
=E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 file by compiling its source file.  The r=
ecompilation must
be done if the source file, or any of the header files named as
prerequisites, is more recent than the object file, or if the object
file does not exist.
</p>
<p>The other rules are processed because their targets appear as
prerequisites of the goal.  If some other rule is not depended on by the
goal (or anything it depends on, etc.), that rule is not processed,
unless you tell <code>make</code> to do so (with a command such as
<code>make&nbsp;clean</code><!-- /@w -->).
</p>
<p>Before recompiling an object file, <code>make</code> considers updating =
its
prerequisites, the source file and header files.  This makefile does not
specify anything to be done for them=E2=80=94the =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=
=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>.h</samp>=E2=80=99 files
are not the targets of any rules=E2=80=94so <code>make</code> does nothing =
for these
files.  But <code>make</code> would update automatically generated C progra=
ms,
such as those made by Bison or Yacc, by their own rules at this time.
</p>
<p>After recompiling whichever object files need it, <code>make</code> deci=
des
whether to relink <samp>edit</samp>.  This must be done if the file
<samp>edit</samp> does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer t=
han
it.  If an object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than
<samp>edit</samp>, so <samp>edit</samp> is relinked.
<span id=3D"index-relinking"></span>
</p>
<p>Thus, if we change the file <samp>insert.c</samp> and run <code>make</co=
de>,
<code>make</code> will compile that file to update <samp>insert.o</samp>, a=
nd then
link <samp>edit</samp>.  If we change the file <samp>command.h</samp> and r=
un
<code>make</code>, <code>make</code> will recompile the object files <samp>=
kbd.o</samp>,
<samp>command.o</samp> and <samp>files.o</samp> and then link the file <sam=
p>edit</samp>.

2.4 Variables Make Makefiles Simpler</h3>
<span id=3D"index-variables"></span>
<span id=3D"index-simplifying-with-variables"></span>

<p>In our example, we had to list all the object files twice in the rule fo=
r
<samp>edit</samp> (repeated here):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
              insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-objects"></span>
<p>Such duplication is error-prone; if a new object file is added to the
system, we might add it to one list and forget the other.  We can eliminate
the risk and simplify the makefile by using a variable.  <em>Variables</em>
allow a text string to be defined once and substituted in multiple places
later (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Us=
ing-Variables">How to Use Variables</a>).
</p>
<span id=3D"index-OBJECTS"></span>
<span id=3D"index-objs"></span>
<span id=3D"index-OBJS"></span>
<span id=3D"index-obj"></span>
<span id=3D"index-OBJ"></span>
<p>It is standard practice for every makefile to have a variable named
<code>objects</code>, <code>OBJECTS</code>, <code>objs</code>, <code>OBJS</=
code>, <code>obj</code>,
or <code>OBJ</code> which is a list of all object file names.  We would
define such a variable <code>objects</code> with a line like this in the
makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
</pre></div>

<p>Then, each place we want to put a list of the object file names, we can
substitute the variable=E2=80=99s value by writing =E2=80=98<samp>$(objects=
)</samp>=E2=80=99
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Using-Va=
riables">How to Use Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>Here is how the complete simple makefile looks when you use a variable
for the object files:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)
main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c

<span id=3D"index-rule_002c-implicit_002c-introduction-to"></span>

<p>It is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the individua=
l
C source files, because <code>make</code> can figure them out: it has an
<em>implicit rule</em> for updating a =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 fil=
e from a correspondingly
named =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 file using a =E2=80=98<samp>cc -c</=
samp>=E2=80=99 command.  For example, it will
use the recipe =E2=80=98<samp>cc -c main.c -o main.o</samp>=E2=80=99 to com=
pile <samp>main.c</samp> into
<samp>main.o</samp>.  We can therefore omit the recipes from the rules for =
the
object files.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make=
.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>When a =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 file is used automatically in t=
his way, it is also
automatically added to the list of prerequisites.  We can therefore omit
the =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 files from the prerequisites, provide=
d we omit the recipe.
</p>
<p>Here is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable
<code>objects</code> as suggested above:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

main.o : defs.h
kbd.o : defs.h command.h
command.o : defs.h command.h
display.o : defs.h buffer.h
insert.o : defs.h buffer.h
search.o : defs.h buffer.h
files.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h
utils.o : defs.h

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm edit $(objects)
</pre></div>

<p>This is how we would write the makefile in actual practice.  (The
complications associated with =E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=99 are desc=
ribed elsewhere.

ther Style of Makefile</h3>
<span id=3D"index-combining-rules-by-prerequisite"></span>

<p>When the objects of a makefile are created only by implicit rules, an
alternative style of makefile is possible.  In this style of makefile,
you group entries by their prerequisites instead of by their targets.
Here is what one looks like:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

$(objects) : defs.h
kbd.o command.o files.o : command.h
display.o insert.o search.o files.o : buffer.h
</pre></div>

<p>Here <samp>defs.h</samp> is given as a prerequisite of all the object fi=
les;
<samp>command.h</samp> and <samp>buffer.h</samp> are prerequisites of the s=
pecific
object files listed for them.
</p>
<p>Whether this is better is a matter of taste: it is more compact, but som=
e
people dislike it because they find it clearer to put all the information
about each target in one place.

2.7 Rules for Cleaning the Directory</h3>
<span id=3D"index-cleaning-up"></span>
<span id=3D"index-removing_002c-to-clean-up"></span>

<p>Compiling a program is not the only thing you might want to write rules
for.  Makefiles commonly tell how to do a few other things besides
compiling a program: for example, how to delete all the object files
and executables so that the directory is =E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=
=99.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-clean-target-1"></span>
<p>Here is how we
could write a <code>make</code> rule for cleaning our example editor:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">clean:
        rm edit $(objects)
</pre></div>

<p>In practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more
complicated manner to handle unanticipated situations.  We would do this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.PHONY : clean
clean :
        -rm edit $(objects)
</pre></div>

<p>This prevents <code>make</code> from getting confused by an actual file
called <samp>clean</samp> and causes it to continue in spite of errors from
<code>rm</code>.  (See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/=
make.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>, and <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.=
org/software/make/manual/make.html#Errors">Errors in
Recipes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A rule such as this should not be placed at the beginning of the
makefile, because we do not want it to run by default!  Thus, in the
example makefile, we want the rule for <code>edit</code>, which recompiles
the editor, to remain the default goal.
</p>
<p>Since <code>clean</code> is not a prerequisite of <code>edit</code>, thi=
s rule will not
run at all if we give the command =E2=80=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99 with =
no arguments.  In
order to make the rule run, we have to type =E2=80=98<samp>make clean</samp=
>=E2=80=99.

<span id=3D"What-Makefiles-Contain"></span><h3 class=3D"section">3.1 What M=
akefiles Contain</h3>

<p>Makefiles contain five kinds of things: <em>explicit rules</em>,
<em>implicit rules</em>, <em>variable definitions</em>, <em>directives</em>=
,
and <em>comments</em>.  Rules, variables, and directives are described at
length in later chapters.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <span id=3D"index-rule_002c-explicit_002c-definition-of"></span>
<span id=3D"index-explicit-rule_002c-definition-of"></span>
An <em>explicit rule</em> says when and how to remake one or more files,
called the rule=E2=80=99s <em>targets</em>.  It lists the other files that =
the
targets depend on, called the <em>prerequisites</em> of the target, and
may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rules">Wr=
iting Rules</a>.

</li><li> <span id=3D"index-rule_002c-implicit_002c-definition-of"></span>
<span id=3D"index-implicit-rule_002c-definition-of"></span>
An <em>implicit rule</em> says when and how to remake a class of files
based on their names.  It describes how a target may depend on a file
with a name similar to the target and gives a recipe to create or
update such a target.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/man=
ual/make.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>.

</li><li> <span id=3D"index-variable-definition"></span>
A <em>variable definition</em> is a line that specifies a text string
value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later.  The
simple makefile example shows a variable definition for <code>objects</code=
>
as a list of all object files (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/=
make/manual/make.html#Variables-Simplify">Variables
Make Makefiles Simpler</a>).

</li><li> <span id=3D"index-directive"></span>
A <em>directive</em> is an instruction for <code>make</code> to do somethin=
g
special while reading the makefile.  These include:

<ul>
<li> Reading another makefile (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/=
make/manual/make.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>).

</li><li> Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or
ignore a part of the makefile (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/=
make/manual/make.html#Conditionals">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</a>).

</li><li> Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple li=
nes
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multi_00=
2dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>).
</li></ul>

</li><li> <span id=3D"index-comments_002c-in-makefile"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_0023-_0028comments_0029_002c-in-makefile"></span>
=E2=80=98<samp>#</samp>=E2=80=99 in a line of a makefile starts a <em>comme=
nt</em>.  It and the
rest of the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash not
escaped by another backslash will continue the comment across multiple
lines.  A line containing just a comment (with perhaps spaces before
it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.  If you want a literal
<code>#</code>, escape it with a backslash (e.g., <code>\#</code>).  Commen=
ts may
appear on any line in the makefile, although they are treated
specially in certain situations.

<p>You cannot use comments within variable references or function calls:
any instance of <code>#</code> will be treated literally (rather than as th=
e
start of a comment) inside a variable reference or function call.
</p>
<p>Comments within a recipe are passed to the shell, just as with any
other recipe text.  The shell decides how to interpret it: whether or
not this is a comment is up to the shell.
</p>
<p>Within a <code>define</code> directive, comments are not ignored during =
the
definition of the variable, but rather kept intact in the value of the
variable.  When the variable is expanded they will either be treated
as <code>make</code> comments or as recipe text, depending on the context i=
n
which the variable is evaluated.

<span id=3D"index-backslash-_0028_005c_0029_002c-to-quote-newlines"></span>

<p>Makefiles use a =E2=80=9Cline-based=E2=80=9D syntax in which the newline=
 character
is special and marks the end of a statement.  GNU <code>make</code> has no
limit on the length of a statement line, up to the amount of memory in
your computer.
</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to read lines which are too long to display
without wrapping or scrolling.  So, you can format your makefiles for
readability by adding newlines into the middle of a statement: you do
this by escaping the internal newlines with a backslash (<code>\</code>)
character.  Where we need to make a distinction we will refer to
=E2=80=9Cphysical lines=E2=80=9D as a single line ending with a newline (re=
gardless
of whether it is escaped) and a =E2=80=9Clogical line=E2=80=9D being a comp=
lete
statement including all escaped newlines up to the first non-escaped
newline.
</p>
<p>The way in which backslash/newline combinations are handled depends on
whether the statement is a recipe line or a non-recipe line.  Handling
of backslash/newline in a recipe line is discussed later
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Splittin=
g-Recipe-Lines">Splitting Recipe Lines</a>).
</p>
<p>Outside of recipe lines, backslash/newlines are converted into a
single space character.  Once that is done, all whitespace around the
backslash/newline is condensed into a single space: this includes all
whitespace preceding the backslash, all whitespace at the beginning of
the line after the backslash/newline, and any consecutive
backslash/newline combinations.
</p>
<p>If the <code>.POSIX</code> special target is defined then backslash/newl=
ine
handling is modified slightly to conform to POSIX.2: first, whitespace
preceding a backslash is not removed and second, consecutive
backslash/newlines are not condensed.
</p>
<span id=3D"Splitting-Without-Adding-Whitespace"></span><h4 class=3D"subsub=
heading">Splitting Without Adding Whitespace</h4>
<span id=3D"index-whitespace_002c-avoiding-on-line-split"></span>
<span id=3D"index-removing-whitespace-from-split-lines"></span>

<p>If you need to split a line but do <em>not</em> want any whitespace
added, you can utilize a subtle trick: replace your backslash/newline
pairs with the three characters dollar sign, backslash, and newline:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">var :=3D one$\
       word
</pre></div>

<p>After <code>make</code> removes the backslash/newline and condenses the
following line into a single space, this is equivalent to:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">var :=3D one$ word
</pre></div>

<p>Then <code>make</code> will perform variable expansion.  The variable
reference =E2=80=98<samp>$ </samp>=E2=80=99 refers to a variable with the o=
ne-character name
=E2=80=9C =E2=80=9D (space) which does not exist, and so expands to the emp=
ty
string, giving a final assignment which is the equivalent of:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">var :=3D oneword
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-makefile-name"></span>
<span id=3D"index-name-of-makefile"></span>
<span id=3D"index-default-makefile-name"></span>
<span id=3D"index-file-name-of-makefile"></span>

<p>By default, when <code>make</code> looks for the makefile, it tries the
following names, in order: <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>, <samp>makefile</samp>
and <samp>Makefile</samp>.
<span id=3D"index-Makefile"></span>
<span id=3D"index-GNUmakefile"></span>
<span id=3D"index-makefile-1"></span>
</p>
<span id=3D"index-README"></span>
<p>Normally you should call your makefile either <samp>makefile</samp> or
<samp>Makefile</samp>.  (We recommend <samp>Makefile</samp> because it appe=
ars
prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other
important files such as <samp>README</samp>.)  The first name checked,
<samp>GNUmakefile</samp>, is not recommended for most makefiles.  You shoul=
d
use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU
<code>make</code>, and will not be understood by other versions of
<code>make</code>.  Other <code>make</code> programs look for <samp>makefil=
e</samp> and
<samp>Makefile</samp>, but not <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>.
</p>
<p>If <code>make</code> finds none of these names, it does not use any make=
file.
Then you must specify a goal with a command argument, and <code>make</code>
will attempt to figure out how to remake it using only its built-in
implicit rules.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ma=
ke.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>.

<span id=3D"index-_002d_002dmakefile"></span>
<p>If you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can specify
the makefile name with the =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<s=
amp>--file</samp>=E2=80=99 option.  The

 use
more than one =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--file</s=
amp>=E2=80=99 option, you can specify several
makefiles.  All the makefiles are effectively concatenated in the order
specified.  The default makefile names <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>,
<samp>makefile</samp> and <samp>Makefile</samp> are not checked automatical=
ly if you
specify =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--file</samp>=
=E2=80=99.

<span id=3D"index-makefile_002c-including"></span>

<span id=3D"index-include"></span>
<p>The <code>include</code> directive tells <code>make</code> to suspend re=
ading the
current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing.
The directive is a line in the makefile that looks like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">include <var>filenames</var>=E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p><var>filenames</var> can contain shell file name patterns.  If
<var>filenames</var> is empty, nothing is included and no error is printed.
<span id=3D"index-shell-file-name-pattern-_0028in-include_0029"></span>
<span id=3D"index-shell-wildcards-_0028in-include_0029"></span>
<span id=3D"index-wildcard_002c-in-include"></span>
</p>
<p>Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line, but
the first character must not be a tab (or the value of
<code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code>)=E2=80=94if the line begins with a tab, it will =
be
considered a recipe line.  Whitespace is required between
<code>include</code> and the file names, and between file names; extra
whitespace is ignored there and at the end of the directive.  A
comment starting with =E2=80=98<samp>#</samp>=E2=80=99 is allowed at the en=
d of the line.  If
the file names contain any variable or function references, they are
expanded.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.htm=
l#Using-Variables">How to Use Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>For example, if you have three <samp>.mk</samp> files, <samp>a.mk</samp>=
,
<samp>b.mk</samp>, and <samp>c.mk</samp>, and <code>$(bar)</code> expands t=
o
<code>bish bash</code>, then the following expression
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">include foo *.mk $(bar)
</pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">include foo a.mk b.mk c.mk bish bash
</pre></div>

<p>When <code>make</code> processes an <code>include</code> directive, it s=
uspends
reading of the containing makefile and reads from each listed file in
turn.  When that is finished, <code>make</code> resumes reading the
makefile in which the directive appears.
</p>
<p>One occasion for using <code>include</code> directives is when several p=
rograms,
handled by individual makefiles in various directories, need to use a
common set of variable definitions
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting"=
>Setting Variables</a>) or pattern rules
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-=
Rules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>).
</p>
<p>Another such occasion is when you want to generate prerequisites from
source files automatically; the prerequisites can be put in a file that
is included by the main makefile.  This practice is generally cleaner
than that of somehow appending the prerequisites to the end of the main
makefile as has been traditionally done with other versions of
<code>make</code>.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual=
/make.html#Automatic-Prerequisites">Generating Prerequisites Automatically<=
/a>.

<p>If the specified name does not start with a slash (or a drive letter and=
 colon
when GNU Make is compiled with MS-DOS / MS-Windows path support), and the f=
ile
is not found in the current directory, several other directories are search=
ed.
First, any directories you have specified with the =E2=80=98<samp>-I</samp>=
=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--include-dir</samp>=E2=80=99 options are searched (see <a h=
ref=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">=
Summary of
Options</a>).  Then the following directories (if they exist) are searched,=
 in
this order: <samp><var>prefix</var>/include</samp> (normally <samp>/usr/loc=
al/include</samp>
<a id=3D"DOCF1" href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#=
FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>)
<samp>/usr/gnu/include</samp>, <samp>/usr/local/include</samp>, <samp>/usr/=
include</samp>.
</p>
<p>The <code>.INCLUDE_DIRS</code> variable will contain the current list of
directories that make will search for included files.  See <a href=3D"https=
://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Spec=
ial Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>You can avoid searching in these default directories by adding the
command line option <code>-I</code> with the special value <code>-</code> (=
e.g.,
<code>-I-</code>) to the command line.  This will cause <code>make</code> t=
o
forget any already-set include directories, including the default
directories.
</p>
<p>If an included makefile cannot be found in any of these directories it i=
s not
an immediately fatal error; processing of the makefile containing the
<code>include</code> continues.  Once it has finished reading makefiles, <c=
ode>make</code>
will try to remake any that are out of date or don=E2=80=99t exist.  See <a=
 href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefi=
les">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>.  Only after it has failed to find a
rule to remake the makefile, or it found a rule but the recipe failed, will
<code>make</code> diagnose the missing makefile as a fatal error.
</p>
<p>If you want <code>make</code> to simply ignore a makefile which does not=
 exist
or cannot be remade, with no error message, use the <code><span class=3D"no=
linebreak">-include</span></code><!-- /@w -->
directive instead of <code>include</code>, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">-include <var>filenames</var>=E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p>This acts like <code>include</code> in every way except that there is no
error (not even a warning) if any of the <var>filenames</var> (or any
prerequisites of any of the <var>filenames</var>) do not exist or cannot be
remade.
</p>
<p>For compatibility with some other <code>make</code> implementations,
<code>sinclude</code> is another name for <code><span class=3D"nolinebreak"=
>-include</span></code><!-- /@w -->.

<p>If the environment variable <code>MAKEFILES</code> is defined, <code>mak=
e</code>
considers its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of
additional makefiles to be read before the others.  This works much
like the <code>include</code> directive: various directories are searched
for those files (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ma=
ke.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>).  In
addition, the default goal is never taken from one of these makefiles
(or any makefile included by them) and it is not an error if the files
listed in <code>MAKEFILES</code> are not found.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-and-MAKEFILES-variable"></span>
<p>The main use of <code>MAKEFILES</code> is in communication between recur=
sive
invocations of <code>make</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwa=
re/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of
<code>make</code></a>).  It usually is not desirable to set the environment
variable before a top-level invocation of <code>make</code>, because it is
usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside.  However, if
you are running <code>make</code> without a specific makefile, a makefile i=
n
<code>MAKEFILES</code> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit
rules work better, such as defining search paths (see <a href=3D"https://ww=
w.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search">Searching Direct=
ories for Prerequisites</a>).
</p>
<p>Some users are tempted to set <code>MAKEFILES</code> in the environment
automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done.
This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if run by
anyone else.  It is much better to write explicit <code>include</code> dire=
ctives
in the makefiles.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/=
make.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>.

<span id=3D"How-Makefiles-Are-Remade"></span><h3 class=3D"section">3.5 How =
Makefiles Are Remade</h3>
<span id=3D"index-updating-makefiles"></span>
<span id=3D"index-remaking-makefiles"></span>
<span id=3D"index-makefile_002c-remaking-of"></span>
<p>Sometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS
files.  If a makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want
<code>make</code> to get an up-to-date version of the makefile to read in.
</p>
<p>To this end, after reading in all makefiles <code>make</code> will consi=
der
each as a goal target, in the order in which they were processed, and
attempt to update it.  If parallel builds (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.o=
rg/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel">Parallel
Execution</a>) are enabled then makefiles will be rebuilt in parallel as
well.
</p>
<p>If a makefile has a rule which says how to update it (found either in
that very makefile or in another one) or if an implicit rule applies
to it (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Im=
plicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>), it will be
updated if necessary.  After all makefiles have been checked, if any
have actually been changed, <code>make</code> starts with a clean slate and
reads all the makefiles over again.  (It will also attempt to update
each of them over again, but normally this will not change them again,
since they are already up to date.)  Each restart will cause the
special variable <code>MAKE_RESTARTS</code> to be updated (see <a href=3D"h=
ttps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other =
Special Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>If you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and
you want to keep <code>make</code> from performing an implicit rule search
on them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you can use any normal method
of preventing implicit rule look-up to do so.  For example, you can
write an explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty
recipe (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#E=
mpty-Recipes">Using Empty Recipes</a>).
</p>
<p>If the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with a rec=
ipe
but no prerequisites, that file will always be remade (see <a href=3D"https=
://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Double_002dColon">Double-Colo=
n Rules</a>).
In the case of makefiles, a makefile that has a double-colon rule with a
recipe but no prerequisites will be remade every time <code>make</code> is =
run, and
then again after <code>make</code> starts over and reads the makefiles in a=
gain.
This would cause an infinite loop: <code>make</code> would constantly remak=
e the
makefile and restart, and never do anything else.  So, to avoid this,
<code>make</code> will <strong>not</strong> attempt to remake makefiles whi=
ch are specified
as targets of a double-colon rule with a recipe but no prerequisites.
</p>
<p>Phony targets (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/m=
ake.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>) have the same effect: they are n=
ever
considered up-to-date and so an included file marked as phony would cause
<code>make</code> to restart continuously.  To avoid this <code>make</code>=
 will not
attempt to remake makefiles which are marked phony.
</p>
<p>You can take advantage of this to optimize startup time: if you know you=
 don=E2=80=99t
need your <samp>Makefile</samp> to be remade you can prevent make from tryi=
ng to
remake it by adding either:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.PHONY: Makefile
</pre></div>

<p>or:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">Makefile:: ;
</pre></div>

<p>If you do not specify any makefiles to be read with =E2=80=98<samp>-f</s=
amp>=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--file</samp>=E2=80=99 options, <code>make</code> will try t=
he default makefile names;
see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefile-=
Names">What Name to Give Your Makefile</a>.  Unlike
makefiles explicitly requested with =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99 or =
=E2=80=98<samp>--file</samp>=E2=80=99 options,
<code>make</code> is not certain that these makefiles should exist.  Howeve=
r,
if a default makefile does not exist but can be created by running
<code>make</code> rules, you probably want the rules to be run so that the
makefile can be used.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if none of the default makefiles exists, <code>make</code> wi=
ll
try to make each of them until it succeeds in making one, or it runs
out of names to try.  Note that it is not an error if <code>make</code>
cannot find or make any makefile; a makefile is not always
necessary.
</p>
<p>When you use the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--t=
ouch</samp>=E2=80=99 option
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-=
of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>),
you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which
targets to touch.  So the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 option has no e=
ffect on updating
makefiles; they are really updated even if =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=
=99 is specified.
Likewise, =E2=80=98<samp>-q</samp>=E2=80=99 (or =E2=80=98<samp>--question</=
samp>=E2=80=99) and =E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=99 (or
=E2=80=98<samp>--just-print</samp>=E2=80=99) do not prevent updating of mak=
efiles, because an
out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets.
Thus, =E2=80=98<samp>make -f mfile -n foo</samp>=E2=80=99 will update <samp=
>mfile</samp>, read it in,
and then print the recipe to update <samp>foo</samp> and its prerequisites
without running it.  The recipe printed for <samp>foo</samp> will be the on=
e
specified in the updated contents of <samp>mfile</samp>.
</p>
<p>However, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even
the makefiles.  You can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in
the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles.  When the
makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options =E2=80=98<samp=
>-t</samp>=E2=80=99
and so on do apply to them.
</p>
<p>Thus, =E2=80=98<samp>make -f mfile -n mfile foo</samp>=E2=80=99 would re=
ad the makefile
<samp>mfile</samp>, print the recipe needed to update it without actually
running it, and then print the recipe needed to update <samp>foo</samp>
without running that.  The recipe for <samp>foo</samp> will be the one
specified by the existing contents of <samp>mfile</samp>.

<span id=3D"index-overriding-makefiles"></span>
<span id=3D"index-makefile_002c-overriding"></span>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like
another makefile.  You can often use the =E2=80=98<samp>include</samp>=E2=
=80=99 directive to
include one in the other, and add more targets or variable definitions.
However, it is invalid for two makefiles to give different recipes for
the same target.  But there is another way.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-match_002danything-rule_002c-used-to-override"></span>
<p>In the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other),
you can use a match-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any
target that cannot be made from the information in the containing
makefile, <code>make</code> should look in another makefile.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-R=
ules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>, for more information on pa=
ttern rules.
</p>
<p>For example, if you have a makefile called <samp>Makefile</samp> that sa=
ys how
to make the target =E2=80=98<samp>foo</samp>=E2=80=99 (and other targets), =
you can write a
makefile called <samp>GNUmakefile</samp> that contains:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo:
        frobnicate &gt; foo

%: force
        @$(MAKE) -f Makefile $@
force: ;
</pre></div>

<p>If you say =E2=80=98<samp>make foo</samp>=E2=80=99, <code>make</code> wi=
ll find <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>,
read it, and see that to make <samp>foo</samp>, it needs to run the recipe
=E2=80=98<samp>frobnicate &gt; foo</samp>=E2=80=99.  If you say =E2=80=98<s=
amp>make bar</samp>=E2=80=99, <code>make</code> will
find no way to make <samp>bar</samp> in <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>, so it wil=
l use the
recipe from the pattern rule: =E2=80=98<samp>make -f Makefile bar</samp>=E2=
=80=99.  If
<samp>Makefile</samp> provides a rule for updating <samp>bar</samp>, <code>=
make</code>
will apply the rule.  And likewise for any other target that
<samp>GNUmakefile</samp> does not say how to make.
</p>
<p>The way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99, so it matches any target whatever.  The r=
ule specifies a
prerequisite <samp>force</samp>, to guarantee that the recipe will be run e=
ven
if the target file already exists.  We give the <samp>force</samp> target a=
n
empty recipe to prevent <code>make</code> from searching for an implicit ru=
le to
build it=E2=80=94otherwise it would apply the same match-anything rule to
<samp>force</samp> itself and create a prerequisite loop!

<span id=3D"How-make-Reads-a-Makefile"></span><h3 class=3D"section">3.7 How=
 <code>make</code> Reads a Makefile</h3>
<span id=3D"index-reading-makefiles"></span>
<span id=3D"index-makefile_002c-reading"></span>

<p>GNU <code>make</code> does its work in two distinct phases.  During the
first phase it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and
internalizes all the variables and their values and implicit and
explicit rules, and builds a dependency graph of all the targets and
their prerequisites.  During the second phase, <code>make</code> uses this
internalized data to determine which targets need to be updated and
run the recipes necessary to update them.
</p>
<p>It=E2=80=99s important to understand this two-phase approach because it =
has a
direct impact on how variable and function expansion happens; this is
often a source of some confusion when writing makefiles.  Below is a
summary of the different constructs that can be found in a makefile,
and the phase in which expansion happens for each part of the
construct.
</p>
<p>We say that expansion is <em>immediate</em> if it happens during the
first phase: <code>make</code> will expand that part of the construct as th=
e
makefile is parsed.  We say that expansion is <em>deferred</em> if it is
not immediate.  Expansion of a deferred construct part is delayed
until the expansion is used: either when it is referenced in an
immediate context, or when it is needed during the second phase.
</p>
<p>You may not be familiar with some of these constructs yet.  You can
reference this section as you become familiar with them, in later
chapters.

<p>Variable definitions are parsed as follows:

<p>For the append operator =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, the right-h=

(=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=

</p>
<p>For the <var>immediate-with-escape</var> operator =E2=80=98<samp>:::=3D<=
/samp>=E2=80=99, the value on
the right-hand side is immediately expanded but then escaped (that is,
all instances of <code>$</code> in the result of the expansion are replaced
with <code>$$</code>).
</p>
<p>For the shell assignment operator =E2=80=98<samp>!=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, t=
he right-hand side is
evaluated immediately and handed to the shell.  The result is stored
in the variable named on the left, and that variable is considered a
recursively expanded variable (and will thus be re-evaluated on each
reference).

<span id=3D"index-ifndef_002c-expansion"></span>
<span id=3D"index-ifneq_002c-expansion"></span>

<p>Conditional directives are parsed immediately.  This means, for
example, that automatic variables cannot be used in conditional
directives, as automatic variables are not set until the recipe for
that rule is invoked.  If you need to use automatic variables in a
conditional directive you <em>must</em> move the condition into the
recipe and use shell conditional syntax instead.

<span id=3D"index-explicit-rule_002c-expansion"></span>

<p>A rule is always expanded the same way, regardless of the form:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>immediate</var> : <var>immediate</var> ; <var>d=
eferred</var>
        <var>deferred</var>
</pre></div>

<p>That is, the target and prerequisite sections are expanded
immediately, and the recipe used to build the target is always
deferred.  This is true for explicit rules, pattern rules, suffix
rules, static pattern rules, and simple prerequisite definitions.

make.html#Reading-Makefiles">How <code>make</code> Reads a
Makefile</a>).

</li><li> Scan the line for a separator character, such as =E2=80=98<samp>:=
</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99,
to determine whether the line is a macro assignment or a rule
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recipe-S=
yntax">Recipe Syntax</a>).

</li><li> Internalize the resulting operation and read the next line.
</li></ol>

<p>An important consequence of this is that a macro can expand to an
entire rule, <em>if it is one line long</em>.  This will work:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">myrule =3D target : ; echo built

$(myrule)
</pre></div>

<p>However, this will not work because <code>make</code> does not re-split =
lines
after it has expanded them:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">define myrule
target:
        echo built
endef

$(myrule)
</pre></div>

<p>The above makefile results in the definition of a target =E2=80=98<samp>=
target</samp>=E2=80=99
with prerequisites =E2=80=98<samp>echo</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>b=
uilt</samp>=E2=80=99, as if the makefile
contained <code>target: echo built</code>, rather than a rule with a recipe=
.
Newlines still present in a line after expansion is complete are
ignored as normal whitespace.
</p>
<p>In order to properly expand a multi-line macro you must use the
<code>eval</code> function: this causes the <code>make</code> parser to be =
run on
the results of the expanded macro (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softw=
are/make/manual/make.html#Eval-Function">The <code>eval</code> Function</a>=
).

<p>Previously we learned that GNU <code>make</code> works in two distinct
phases: a read-in phase and a target-update phase (see <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Reading-Makefiles">How <code>make=
</code> Reads a Makefile</a>).  GNU Make also has
the ability to enable a <em>second expansion</em> of the prerequisites
(only) for some or all targets defined in the makefile.  In order for
this second expansion to occur, the special target
<code>.SECONDEXPANSION</code> must be defined before the first prerequisite
list that makes use of this feature.
</p>
<p>If <code>.SECONDEXPANSION</code> is defined then when GNU <code>make</co=
de> needs to check
the prerequisites of a target, the prerequisites are expanded a <em>second
time</em>.  In most circumstances this secondary expansion will have no eff=
ect,
since all variable and function references will have been expanded during t=
he
initial parsing of the makefiles.  In order to take advantage of the second=
ary
expansion phase of the parser, then, it=E2=80=99s necessary to <em>escape</=
em> the
variable or function reference in the makefile.  In this case the first
expansion merely un-escapes the reference but doesn=E2=80=99t expand it, an=
d expansion
is left to the secondary expansion phase.  For example, consider this
makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SECONDEXPANSION:
ONEVAR =3D onefile
TWOVAR =3D twofile
myfile: $(ONEVAR) $$(TWOVAR)
</pre></div>

<p>After the first expansion phase the prerequisites list of the
<samp>myfile</samp> target will be <code>onefile</code> and <code>$(TWOVAR)=
</code>; the
first (unescaped) variable reference to <var>ONEVAR</var> is expanded,
while the second (escaped) variable reference is simply unescaped,
without being recognized as a variable reference.  Now during the
secondary expansion the first word is expanded again but since it
contains no variable or function references it remains the value
<samp>onefile</samp>, while the second word is now a normal reference to th=
e
variable <var>TWOVAR</var>, which is expanded to the value <samp>twofile</s=
amp>.
The final result is that there are two prerequisites, <samp>onefile</samp>
and <samp>twofile</samp>.
</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a very interesting case since the same result
could more easily have been achieved simply by having both variables
appear, unescaped, in the prerequisites list.  One difference becomes
apparent if the variables are reset; consider this example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SECONDEXPANSION:
AVAR =3D top
onefile: $(AVAR)
twofile: $$(AVAR)
AVAR =3D bottom
</pre></div>

<p>Here the prerequisite of <samp>onefile</samp> will be expanded immediate=
ly,
and resolve to the value <samp>top</samp>, while the prerequisite of
<samp>twofile</samp> will not be full expanded until the secondary expansio=
n
and yield a value of <samp>bottom</samp>.
</p>
<p>This is marginally more exciting, but the true power of this feature
only becomes apparent when you discover that secondary expansions
always take place within the scope of the automatic variables for that
target.  This means that you can use variables such as <code>$@</code>,
<code>$*</code>, etc. during the second expansion and they will have their
expected values, just as in the recipe.  All you have to do is defer
the expansion by escaping the <code>$</code>.  Also, secondary expansion
occurs for both explicit and implicit (pattern) rules.  Knowing this,
the possible uses for this feature increase dramatically.  For
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SECONDEXPANSION:
main_OBJS :=3D main.o try.o test.o
lib_OBJS :=3D lib.o api.o

main lib: $$($$@_OBJS)
</pre></div>

<p>Here, after the initial expansion the prerequisites of both the
<samp>main</samp> and <samp>lib</samp> targets will be <code>$($@_OBJS)</co=
de>.  During
the secondary expansion, the <code>$@</code> variable is set to the name of
the target and so the expansion for the <samp>main</samp> target will yield
<code>$(main_OBJS)</code>, or <code>main.o try.o test.o</code>, while the
secondary expansion for the <samp>lib</samp> target will yield
<code>$(lib_OBJS)</code>, or <code>lib.o api.o</code>.
</p>
<p>You can also mix in functions here, as long as they are properly escaped=
:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">main_SRCS :=3D main.c try.c test.c
lib_SRCS :=3D lib.c api.c

.SECONDEXPANSION:
main lib: $$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$$($$@_SRCS))
</pre></div>

<p>This version allows users to specify source files rather than object
files, but gives the same resulting prerequisites list as the previous
example.
</p>
<p>Evaluation of automatic variables during the secondary expansion
phase, especially of the target name variable <code>$$@</code>, behaves
similarly to evaluation within recipes.  However, there are some
subtle differences and =E2=80=9Ccorner cases=E2=80=9D which come into play =
for the
different types of rule definitions that <code>make</code> understands.  Th=
e
subtleties of using the different automatic variables are described
below.
</p>
<span id=3D"Secondary-Expansion-of-Explicit-Rules"></span><h4 class=3D"subh=
eading">Secondary Expansion of Explicit Rules</h4>
<span id=3D"index-secondary-expansion-and-explicit-rules"></span>
<span id=3D"index-explicit-rules_002c-secondary-expansion-of"></span>

<p>During the secondary expansion of explicit rules, <code>$$@</code> and
<code>$$%</code> evaluate, respectively, to the file name of the target and=
,
when the target is an archive member, the target member name.  The
<code>$$&lt;</code> variable evaluates to the first prerequisite in the fir=
st
rule for this target.  <code>$$^</code> and <code>$$+</code> evaluate to th=
e list
of all prerequisites of rules <em>that have already appeared</em> for
the same target (<code>$$+</code> with repetitions and <code>$$^</code>
without).  The following example will help illustrate these behaviors:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SECONDEXPANSION:

foo: foo.1 bar.1 $$&lt; $$^ $$+    # line #1

foo: foo.2 bar.2 $$&lt; $$^ $$+    # line #2

foo: foo.3 bar.3 $$&lt; $$^ $$+    # line #3
</pre></div>

<p>In the first prerequisite list, all three variables (<code>$$&lt;</code>=
,
<code>$$^</code>, and <code>$$+</code>) expand to the empty string.  In the
second, they will have values <code>foo.1</code>, <code>foo.1 bar.1</code>,=
 and
<code>foo.1 bar.1</code> respectively.  In the third they will have values
<code>foo.1</code>, <code>foo.1 bar.1 foo.2 bar.2</code>, and <code>foo.1 b=
ar.1
foo.2 bar.2 foo.1 foo.1 bar.1 foo.1 bar.1</code> respectively.
</p>
<p>Rules undergo secondary expansion in makefile order, except that
the rule with the recipe is always evaluated last.
</p>
<p>The variables <code>$$?</code> and <code>$$*</code> are not available an=
d expand
to the empty string.
</p>
<span id=3D"Secondary-Expansion-of-Static-Pattern-Rules"></span><h4 class=
=3D"subheading">Secondary Expansion of Static Pattern Rules</h4>
<span id=3D"index-secondary-expansion-and-static-pattern-rules"></span>
<span id=3D"index-static-pattern-rules_002c-secondary-expansion-of"></span>

<p>Rules for secondary expansion of static pattern rules are identical to
those for explicit rules, above, with one exception: for static
pattern rules the <code>$$*</code> variable is set to the pattern stem.  As
with explicit rules, <code>$$?</code> is not available and expands to the
empty string.
</p>
<span id=3D"Secondary-Expansion-of-Implicit-Rules"></span><h4 class=3D"subh=
eading">Secondary Expansion of Implicit Rules</h4>
<span id=3D"index-secondary-expansion-and-implicit-rules"></span>
<span id=3D"index-implicit-rules_002c-secondary-expansion-of"></span>

<p>As <code>make</code> searches for an implicit rule, it substitutes the s=
tem
and then performs secondary expansion for every rule with a matching
target pattern.  The value of the automatic variables is derived in
the same fashion as for static pattern rules.  As an example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SECONDEXPANSION:

foo: bar

foo foz: fo%: bo%

%oo: $$&lt; $$^ $$+ $$*
</pre></div>

<p>When the implicit rule is tried for target <samp>foo</samp>, <code>$$&lt=
;</code>
expands to <samp>bar</samp>, <code>$$^</code> expands to <samp>bar boo</sam=
p>,
<code>$$+</code> also expands to <samp>bar boo</samp>, and <code>$$*</code>=
 expands to
<samp>f</samp>.
</p>
<p>Note that the directory prefix (D), as described in <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rule-Search">Implicit Ru=
le Search Algorithm</a>, is appended (after
expansion) to all the patterns in the prerequisites list.  As an
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SECONDEXPANSION:

/tmp/foo.o:

%.o: $$(addsuffix /%.c,foo bar) foo.h
        @echo $^
</pre></div>

<p>The prerequisite list printed, after the secondary expansion and
directory prefix reconstruction, will be <samp>/tmp/foo/foo.c
/tmp/bar/foo.c foo.h</samp>.  If you are not interested in this
reconstruction, you can use <code>$$*</code> instead of <code>%</code> in t=
he
prerequisites list.

<span id=3D"index-target"></span>
<span id=3D"index-prerequisite"></span>

<p>A <em>rule</em> appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake
certain files, called the rule=E2=80=99s <em>targets</em> (most often only =
one per rule).
It lists the other files that are the <em>prerequisites</em> of the target,=
 and
the <em>recipe</em> to use to create or update the target.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-default-goal-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-goal_002c-default-1"></span>
<p>The order of rules is not significant, except for determining the <em>de=
fault
goal</em>: the target for <code>make</code> to consider, if you do not othe=
rwise specify
one.  The default goal is the first target of the first rule in the first
makefile.  There are two exceptions: a target starting with a period is not=
 a
default unless it also contains one or more slashes, =E2=80=98<samp>/</samp=
>=E2=80=99; and, a target
that defines a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal.  (See <a hre=
f=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules">Defi=
ning and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>.)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is the
one for compiling the entire program or all the programs described by
the makefile (often with a target called =E2=80=98<samp>all</samp>=E2=80=99=
).

guments to Specify the Goals</a>.

<p>Here is an example of a rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o : foo.c defs.h       # module for twiddling th=
e frobs
        cc -c -g foo.c
</pre></div>

<p>Its target is <samp>foo.o</samp> and its prerequisites are <samp>foo.c</=

<samp>defs.h</samp>.  It has one command in the recipe: =E2=80=98<samp>cc -=
c -g foo.c</samp>=E2=80=99.
The recipe starts with a tab to identify it as a recipe.
</p>
<p>This rule says two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li> How to decide whether <samp>foo.o</samp> is out of date: it is out of =
date
if it does not exist, or if either <samp>foo.c</samp> or <samp>defs.h</samp=

more recent than it.

</li><li> How to update the file <samp>foo.o</samp>: by running <code>cc</c=

<p>In general, a rule looks like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>targets</var> : <var>prerequisites</var>
        <var>recipe</var>
        =E2=80=A6

<p>or like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>targets</var> : <var>prerequisites</var> ; <var=
>recipe</var>
        <var>recipe</var>
        =E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-targets"></span>
<span id=3D"index-rule-targets"></span>
<p>The <var>targets</var> are file names, separated by spaces.  Wildcard
characters may be used (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ma=
nual/make.html#Wildcards">Using Wildcard Characters
in File Names</a>) and a name of the form <samp><var>a</var>(<var>m</var>)<=
/samp>
represents member <var>m</var> in archive file <var>a</var>
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archive-=
Members">Archive Members as Targets</a>).
Usually there is only one
target per rule, but occasionally there is a reason to have more
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multiple=
-Targets">Multiple Targets in a Rule</a>).
</p>
<span id=3D"index-recipes"></span>
<span id=3D"index-tab-character-_0028in-commands_0029"></span>
<p>The <var>recipe</var> lines start with a tab character (or the first
character in the value of the <code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable;
see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-V=
ariables">Other Special Variables</a>).  The first recipe line may appear o=
n the line
after the prerequisites, with a tab character, or may appear on the
same line, with a semicolon.  Either way, the effect is the same.
There are other differences in the syntax of recipes.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recipes">=
Writing Recipes in Rules</a>.

<span id=3D"index-_0024_002c-in-rules"></span>
<span id=3D"index-rules_002c-and-_0024"></span>
<p>Because dollar signs are used to start <code>make</code> variable
references, if you really want a dollar sign in a target or
prerequisite you must write two of them, =E2=80=98<samp>$$</samp>=E2=80=99 =
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Using-Va=
riables">How to Use Variables</a>).  If you have enabled secondary
expansion (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.htm=
l#Secondary-Expansion">Secondary Expansion</a>) and you want a literal doll=
ar
sign in the prerequisites list, you must actually write <em>four</em>
dollar signs (=E2=80=98<samp>$$$$</samp>=E2=80=99).
</p>
<p>You may split a long line by inserting a backslash followed by a
newline, but this is not required, as <code>make</code> places no limit on
the length of a line in a makefile.
</p>
<p>A rule tells <code>make</code> two things: when the targets are out of d=
ate,
and how to update them when necessary.

<p>The criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the
<var>prerequisites</var>, which consist of file names separated by spaces.
(Wildcards and archive members (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software=
/make/manual/make.html#Archives">Using <code>make</code> to Update Archive =
Files</a>) are allowed here too.)
A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any
of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times).  The
idea is that the contents of the target file are computed based on
information in the prerequisites, so if any of the prerequisites changes,
the contents of the existing target file are no longer necessarily
valid.
</p>
<p>How to update is specified by a <var>recipe</var>.  This is one or more
lines to be executed by the shell (normally =E2=80=98<samp>sh</samp>=E2=80=
=99), but with some
extra features (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=

of Prerequisites</h3>

<span id=3D"index-prerequisites_002c-order_002donly"></span>
<span id=3D"index-order_002donly-prerequisites"></span>
<p>There are two different types of prerequisites understood by GNU <code>m=
ake</code>:
normal prerequisites, described in the previous section, and <em>order-only=
</em>
prerequisites.  A normal prerequisite makes two statements: first, it impos=
es
an order in which recipes will be invoked: the recipes for all prerequisite=
s
of a target will be completed before the recipe for the target is started.
Second, it imposes a dependency relationship: if any prerequisite is newer
than the target, then the target is considered out-of-date and must be
rebuilt.
</p>
<p>Normally, this is exactly what you want: if a target=E2=80=99s prerequis=
ite is
updated, then the target should also be updated.
</p>
<p>Occasionally you may want to ensure that a prerequisite is built before =
a
target, but <em>without</em> forcing the target to be updated if the
prerequisite is updated.  <em>Order-only</em> prerequisites are used to cre=
ate
this type of relationship.  Order-only prerequisites can be specified by
placing a pipe symbol (<code>|</code>) in the prerequisites list: any prere=
quisites
to the left of the pipe symbol are normal; any prerequisites to the right a=
re
order-only:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>targets</var> : <var>normal-prerequisites</var>=
 | <var>order-only-prerequisites</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The normal prerequisites section may of course be empty.  Also, you
may still declare multiple lines of prerequisites for the same target:
they are appended appropriately (normal prerequisites are appended to
the list of normal prerequisites; order-only prerequisites are
appended to the list of order-only prerequisites).  Note that if you
declare the same file to be both a normal and an order-only
prerequisite, the normal prerequisite takes precedence (since they
have a strict superset of the behavior of an order-only prerequisite).
</p>
<p>Order-only prerequisites are never checked when determining if the
target is out of date; even order-only prerequisites marked as phony
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Phony-Ta=
rgets">Phony Targets</a>) will not cause the target to be rebuilt.
</p>
<p>Consider an example where your targets are to be placed in a separate
directory, and that directory might not exist before <code>make</code> is
run.  In this situation, you want the directory to be created before
any targets are placed into it but, because the timestamps on
directories change whenever a file is added, removed, or renamed, we
certainly don=E2=80=99t want to rebuild all the targets whenever the
directory=E2=80=99s timestamp changes.  One way to manage this is with
order-only prerequisites: make the directory an order-only
prerequisite on all the targets:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">OBJDIR :=3D objdir
OBJS :=3D $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/,foo.o bar.o baz.o)

$(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
        $(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $&lt;

all: $(OBJS)

$(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)

$(OBJDIR):
        mkdir $(OBJDIR)
</pre></div>

<p>Now the rule to create the <samp>objdir</samp> directory will be run, if
needed, before any =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 is built, but no =E2=
=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 will be built
because the <samp>objdir</samp> directory timestamp changed.

<p>A single file name can specify many files using <em>wildcard characters<=
/em>.
The wildcard characters in <code>make</code> are =E2=80=98<samp>*</samp>=E2=
=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>?</samp>=E2=80=99 and
=E2=80=98<samp>[=E2=80=A6]</samp>=E2=80=99, the same as in the Bourne shell=
.  For example, <samp>*.c</samp>
specifies a list of all the files (in the working directory) whose names
end in =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>If an expression matches multiple files then the results will be
sorted.<a id=3D"DOCF2" href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>  However multiple expressions will not be
globally sorted.  For example, <samp>*.c *.h</samp> will list all the files=
 whose
names end in =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99, sorted, followed by all the=
 files whose names end in
=E2=80=98<samp>.h</samp>=E2=80=99, sorted.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_007e-_0028tilde_0029"></span>
<span id=3D"index-tilde-_0028_007e_0029"></span>
<span id=3D"index-home-directory"></span>
<p>The character =E2=80=98<samp>~</samp>=E2=80=99 at the beginning of a fil=
e name also has special
significance.  If alone, or followed by a slash, it represents your home
directory.  For example <samp>~/bin</samp> expands to <samp>/home/you/bin</=
samp>.
If the =E2=80=98<samp>~</samp>=E2=80=99 is followed by a word, the string r=
epresents the home
directory of the user named by that word.  For example <samp>~john/bin</sam=
p>
expands to <samp>/home/john/bin</samp>.  On systems which don=E2=80=99t hav=
e a home
directory for each user (such as MS-DOS or MS-Windows), this
functionality can be simulated by setting the environment variable
<var>HOME</var>.
</p>
<p>Wildcard expansion is performed by <code>make</code> automatically in
targets and in prerequisites.  In recipes, the shell is responsible
for wildcard expansion.  In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens
only if you request it explicitly with the <code>wildcard</code> function.
</p>
<p>The special significance of a wildcard character can be turned off by
preceding it with a backslash.  Thus, <samp>foo\*bar</samp> would refer to =
a
specific file whose name consists of =E2=80=98<samp>foo</samp>=E2=80=99, an=
 asterisk, and
=E2=80=98<samp>bar</samp>=E2=80=99.

<span id=3D"Wildcard-Examples-1"></span><h4 class=3D"subsection">4.4.1 Wild=
card Examples</h4>

<p>Wildcards can be used in the recipe of a rule, where they are expanded
by the shell.  For example, here is a rule to delete all the object files:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">clean:
        rm -f *.o
</pre></div>
<span id=3D"index-rm-_0028shell-command_0029-1"></span>

<p>Wildcards are also useful in the prerequisites of a rule.  With the
following rule in the makefile, =E2=80=98<samp>make print</samp>=E2=80=99 w=
ill print all the
=E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 files that have changed since the last ti=
me you printed them:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">print: *.c
        lpr -p $?
        touch print
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-print-target"></span>
<span id=3D"index-lpr-_0028shell-command_0029"></span>
<span id=3D"index-touch-_0028shell-command_0029"></span>
<p>This rule uses <samp>print</samp> as an empty target file; see <a href=
=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Targets">Empty=
 Target Files to Record Events</a>.  (The automatic variable
=E2=80=98<samp>$?</samp>=E2=80=99 is used to print only those files that ha=
ve changed; see
<a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Var=
iables">Automatic Variables</a>.)
</p>
<p>Wildcard expansion does not happen when you define a variable.  Thus, if
you write this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D *.o
</pre></div>

<p>then the value of the variable <code>objects</code> is the actual string
=E2=80=98<samp>*.o</samp>=E2=80=99.  However, if you use the value of <code=
>objects</code> in a
target or prerequisite, wildcard expansion will take place there.  If
you use the value of <code>objects</code> in a recipe, the shell may perfor=
m
wildcard expansion when the recipe runs.  To set <code>objects</code> to th=
e
expansion, instead use:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects :=3D $(wildcard *.o)

<span id=3D"index-problems-with-wildcards"></span>

<p>Now here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that
does not do what you would intend.  Suppose you would like to say that the
executable file <samp>foo</samp> is made from all the object files in the
directory, and you write this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D *.o

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)
</pre></div>

<p>The value of <code>objects</code> is the actual string =E2=80=98<samp>*.=
o</samp>=E2=80=99.  Wildcard
expansion happens in the rule for <samp>foo</samp>, so that each <em>existi=
ng</em>
=E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 file becomes a prerequisite of <samp>foo<=
/samp> and will be recompiled if
necessary.
</p>
<p>But what if you delete all the =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 files? =
 When a wildcard matches
no files, it is left as it is, so then <samp>foo</samp> will depend on the
oddly-named file <samp>*.o</samp>.  Since no such file is likely to exist,
<code>make</code> will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to
make <samp>*.o</samp>.  This is not what you want!
</p>
<p>Actually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard
expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the
<code>wildcard</code> function and string substitution.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard-=
Function">The Function <code>wildcard</code></a>.

</span>
<span id=3D"index-backslashes-in-pathnames-and-wildcard-expansion"></span>

<p>Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes to
separate directories in pathnames, like so:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">  c:\foo\bar\baz.c
</pre></div>

<p>This is equivalent to the Unix-style <samp>c:/foo/bar/baz.c</samp> (the
<samp>c:</samp> part is the so-called drive letter).  When <code>make</code=
> runs on
these systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-style forward
slashes in pathnames.  However, this support does <em>not</em> include the
wildcard expansion, where backslash is a quote character.  Therefore,
you <em>must</em> use Unix-style slashes in these cases.

<span id=3D"The-Function-wildcard"></span><h4 class=3D"subsection">4.4.3 Th=
e Function <code>wildcard</code></h4>
<span id=3D"index-wildcard-1"></span>

<p>Wildcard expansion happens automatically in rules.  But wildcard expansi=
on
does not normally take place when a variable is set, or inside the
arguments of a function.  If you want to do wildcard expansion in such
places, you need to use the <code>wildcard</code> function, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(wildcard <var>pattern</var>=E2=80=A6)
</pre></div>

<p>This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a
space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the
given file name patterns.  If no existing file name matches a pattern,
then that pattern is omitted from the output of the <code>wildcard</code>
function.  Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards
behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard=
-Pitfall">Pitfalls of Using Wildcards</a>).
</p>
<p>As with wildcard expansion in rules, the results of the <code>wildcard</=
code>
function are sorted.  But again, each individual expression is sorted
separately, so =E2=80=98<samp>$(wildcard *.c *.h)</samp>=E2=80=99 will expa=
nd to all files matching
=E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99, sorted, followed by all files matching =
=E2=80=98<samp>.h</samp>=E2=80=99, sorted.
</p>
<p>One use of the <code>wildcard</code> function is to get a list of all th=
e C source
files in a directory, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(wildcard *.c)
</pre></div>

<p>We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by
replacing the =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 suffix with =E2=80=98<samp>=
.o</samp>=E2=80=99 in the result, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
</pre></div>

<p>(Here we have used another function, <code>patsubst</code>.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Func=
tions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>.)
</p>
<p>Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then
link them together could be written as follows:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects :=3D $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(objects)
</pre></div>

<p>(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so
there is no need to write explicit rules for compiling the files.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">=
The Two Flavors of Variables</a>, for an explanation of
=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, which is a variant of =E2=80=98<samp>=

<code>make</code> facilitate this by searching several directories
automatically to find a prerequisite.  When you redistribute the files

<span id=3D"index-VPATH-1"></span>

<p>The value of the <code>make</code> variable <code>VPATH</code> specifies=
 a list of
directories that <code>make</code> should search.  Most often, the
directories are expected to contain prerequisite files that are not in the
current directory; however, <code>make</code> uses <code>VPATH</code> as a =
search
list for both prerequisites and targets of rules.
</p>
<p>Thus, if a file that is listed as a target or prerequisite does not exis=
t
in the current directory, <code>make</code> searches the directories listed=
 in
<code>VPATH</code> for a file with that name.  If a file is found in one of
them, that file may become the prerequisite (see below).  Rules may then
specify the names of files in the prerequisite list as if they all
existed in the current directory.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softw=
are/make/manual/make.html#Recipes_002fSearch">Writing Recipes with Director=
y Search</a>.
</p>
<p>In the <code>VPATH</code> variable, directory names are separated by col=
ons or
blanks.  The order in which directories are listed is the order followed
by <code>make</code> in its search.  (On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, semi-colons
are used as separators of directory names in <code>VPATH</code>, since the
colon can be used in the pathname itself, after the drive letter.)
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">VPATH =3D src:../headers
</pre></div>

<p>specifies a path containing two directories, <samp>src</samp> and
<samp>../headers</samp>, which <code>make</code> searches in that order.
</p>
<p>With this value of <code>VPATH</code>, the following rule,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o : foo.c
</pre></div>

<p>is interpreted as if it were written like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o : src/foo.c
</pre></div>

<p>assuming the file <samp>foo.c</samp> does not exist in the current direc=
tory but
is found in the directory <samp>src</samp>.

<span id=3D"The-vpath-Directive"></span><h4 class=3D"subsection">4.5.2 The =
<code>vpath</code> Directive</h4>
<span id=3D"index-vpath-2"></span>

<p>Similar to the <code>VPATH</code> variable, but more selective, is the
<code>vpath</code> directive (note lower case), which allows you to specify=
 a
search path for a particular class of file names: those that match a
particular pattern.  Thus you can supply certain search directories for
one class of file names and other directories (or none) for other file
names.
</p>
<p>There are three forms of the <code>vpath</code> directive:
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt><span><code>vpath <var>pattern</var> <var>directories</var></code></spa=
n></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the search path <var>directories</var> for file names that m=
atch
<var>pattern</var>.
</p>
<p>The search path, <var>directories</var>, is a list of directories to be
searched, separated by colons (semi-colons on MS-DOS and MS-Windows) or
blanks, just like the search path used in the <code>VPATH</code> variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>vpath <var>pattern</var></code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Clear out the search path associated with <var>pattern</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>vpath</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Clear all search paths previously specified with <code>vpath</code> dire=
ctives.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>A <code>vpath</code> pattern is a string containing a =E2=80=98<samp>%</=
samp>=E2=80=99 character.  The
string must match the file name of a prerequisite that is being searched
for, the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 character matching any sequence o=
f zero or more
characters (as in pattern rules; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwar=
e/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules">Defining and
Redefining Pattern Rules</a>).  For example, <code>%.h</code> matches files=
 that
end in <code>.h</code>.  (If there is no =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99, =
the pattern must match the
prerequisite exactly, which is not useful very often.)
</p>

<span id=3D"index-quoting-_0025_002c-in-vpath"></span>
<p>=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters in a <code>vpath</code> dire=
ctive=E2=80=99s pattern can be quoted
with preceding backslashes (=E2=80=98<samp>\</samp>=E2=80=99).  Backslashes=
 that would otherwise
quote =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters can be quoted with more b=
ackslashes.
Backslashes that quote =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters or other=
 backslashes are
removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names.  Backslashes
that are not in danger of quoting =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characte=
rs go unmolested.
</p>
<p>When a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the
<var>pattern</var> in a <code>vpath</code> directive matches the name of th=
e
prerequisite file, then the <var>directories</var> in that directive are se=
arched
just like (and before) the directories in the <code>VPATH</code> variable.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">vpath %.h ../headers
</pre></div>

<p>tells <code>make</code> to look for any prerequisite whose name ends in =
<samp>.h</samp>
in the directory <samp>../headers</samp> if the file is not found in the cu=
rrent
directory.
</p>
<p>If several <code>vpath</code> patterns match the prerequisite file=E2=80=
=99s name, then
<code>make</code> processes each matching <code>vpath</code> directive one =
by one,
searching all the directories mentioned in each directive.  <code>make</cod=
e>
handles multiple <code>vpath</code> directives in the order in which they
appear in the makefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are
independent of each other.
</p>
<p>Thus,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">vpath %.c foo
vpath %   blish
vpath %.c bar
</pre></div>

<p>will look for a file ending in =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 in <sam=
p>foo</samp>, then
<samp>blish</samp>, then <samp>bar</samp>, while
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">vpath %.c foo:bar
vpath %   blish
</pre></div>

<p>will look for a file ending in =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 in <sam=
p>foo</samp>, then
<samp>bar</samp>, then <samp>blish</samp>.

<span id=3D"index-algorithm-for-directory-search"></span>
<span id=3D"index-directory-search-algorithm"></span>

<p>When a prerequisite is found through directory search, regardless of typ=
e
(general or selective), the pathname located may not be the one that
<code>make</code> actually provides you in the prerequisite list.  Sometime=
s
the path discovered through directory search is thrown away.
</p>
<p>The algorithm <code>make</code> uses to decide whether to keep or abando=
n a
path found via directory search is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> If a target file does not exist at the path specified in the makefile,
directory search is performed.

</li><li> If the directory search is successful, that path is kept and this=
 file
is tentatively stored as the target.

</li><li> All prerequisites of this target are examined using this same met=
hod.

</li><li> After processing the prerequisites, the target may or may not nee=
d to be
rebuilt:

<ol type=3D"a" start=3D"1">
<li> If the target does <em>not</em> need to be rebuilt, the path to the fi=
le
found during directory search is used for any prerequisite lists which
contain this target.  In short, if <code>make</code> doesn=E2=80=99t need t=
o rebuild
the target then you use the path found via directory search.

</li><li> If the target <em>does</em> need to be rebuilt (is out-of-date), =
the
pathname found during directory search is <em>thrown away</em>, and the
target is rebuilt using the file name specified in the makefile.  In
short, if <code>make</code> must rebuild, then the target is rebuilt locall=
y,
not in the directory found via directory search.
</li></ol>
</li></ol>

<p>This algorithm may seem complex, but in practice it is quite often
exactly what you want.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-traditional-directory-search-_0028GPATH_0029"></span>
<span id=3D"index-directory-search_002c-traditional-_0028GPATH_0029"></span=
>
<p>Other versions of <code>make</code> use a simpler algorithm: if the file=
 does
not exist, and it is found via directory search, then that pathname is
always used whether or not the target needs to be built.  Thus, if the
target is rebuilt it is created at the pathname discovered during
directory search.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-GPATH"></span>
<p>If, in fact, this is the behavior you want for some or all of your
directories, you can use the <code>GPATH</code> variable to indicate this t=
o
<code>make</code>.
</p>
<p><code>GPATH</code> has the same syntax and format as <code>VPATH</code> =
(that is, a
space- or colon-delimited list of pathnames).  If an out-of-date target
is found by directory search in a directory that also appears in
<code>GPATH</code>, then that pathname is not thrown away.  The target is
rebuilt using the expanded path.

<p>When a prerequisite is found in another directory through directory sear=
ch,
this cannot change the recipe of the rule; they will execute as written.
Therefore, you must write the recipe with care so that it will look for
the prerequisite in the directory where <code>make</code> finds it.
</p>
<p>This is done with the <em>automatic variables</em> such as =E2=80=98<sam=
p>$^</samp>=E2=80=99
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automati=
c-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).
For instance, the value of =E2=80=98<samp>$^</samp>=E2=80=99 is a
list of all the prerequisites of the rule, including the names of
the directories in which they were found, and the value of
=E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 is the target.  Thus:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o : foo.c
        cc -c $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@
</pre></div>

<p>(The variable <code>CFLAGS</code> exists so you can specify flags for C
compilation by implicit rules; we use it here for consistency so it will
affect all C compilations uniformly;
see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-=
Variables">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</a>.)
</p>
<p>Often the prerequisites include header files as well, which you do not
want to mention in the recipe.  The automatic variable =E2=80=98<samp>$&lt;=
</samp>=E2=80=99 is
just the first prerequisite:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">VPATH =3D src:../headers
foo.o : foo.c defs.h hack.h
        cc -c $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@

<p>The search through the directories specified in <code>VPATH</code> or wi=
th
<code>vpath</code> also happens during consideration of implicit rules
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit=
-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>).
</p>
<p>For example, when a file <samp>foo.o</samp> has no explicit rule, <code>=
make</code>
considers implicit rules, such as the built-in rule to compile
<samp>foo.c</samp> if that file exists.  If such a file is lacking in the
current directory, the appropriate directories are searched for it.  If
<samp>foo.c</samp> exists (or is mentioned in the makefile) in any of the
directories, the implicit rule for C compilation is applied.
</p>
<p>The recipes of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a
matter of necessity; consequently they will use the file names found by
directory search with no extra effort.

<p>Directory search applies in a special way to libraries used with the
linker.  This special feature comes into play when you write a prerequisite
whose name is of the form =E2=80=98<samp>-l<var>name</var></samp>=E2=80=99.=
  (You can tell something
strange is going on here because the prerequisite is normally the name of a
file, and the <em>file name</em> of a library generally looks like
<samp>lib<var>name</var>.a</samp>, not like =E2=80=98<samp>-l<var>name</var=
></samp>=E2=80=99.)
</p>
<p>When a prerequisite=E2=80=99s name has the form =E2=80=98<samp>-l<var>na=
me</var></samp>=E2=80=99, <code>make</code>
handles it specially by searching for the file <samp>lib<var>name</var>.so<=
/samp>,
and, if it is not found, for the file <samp>lib<var>name</var>.a</samp> in =
the current
directory, in directories specified by matching <code>vpath</code>
search paths and the <code>VPATH</code> search path, and then in the
directories <samp>/lib</samp>, <samp>/usr/lib</samp>, and <samp><var>prefix=
</var>/lib</samp>
(normally <samp>/usr/local/lib</samp>, but MS-DOS/MS-Windows versions of
<code>make</code> behave as if <var>prefix</var> is defined to be the root =
of the
DJGPP installation tree).
</p>
<p>For example, if there is a <samp>/usr/lib/libcurses.a</samp> library on =
your
system (and no <samp>/usr/lib/libcurses.so</samp> file), then
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo : foo.c -lcurses
        cc $^ -o $@
</pre></div>

<p>would cause the command =E2=80=98<samp>cc foo.c /usr/lib/libcurses.a -o =
foo</samp>=E2=80=99 to
be executed when <samp>foo</samp> is older than <samp>foo.c</samp> or than
<samp>/usr/lib/libcurses.a</samp>.
</p>
<p>Although the default set of files to be searched for is
<samp>lib<var>name</var>.so</samp> and <samp>lib<var>name</var>.a</samp>, t=
his is customizable
via the <code>.LIBPATTERNS</code> variable.  Each word in the value of this
variable is a pattern string.  When a prerequisite like
=E2=80=98<samp>-l<var>name</var></samp>=E2=80=99 is seen, <code>make</code>=
 will replace the percent in
each pattern in the list with <var>name</var> and perform the above directo=
ry
searches using each library file name.
</p>
<p>The default value for <code>.LIBPATTERNS</code> is =E2=80=98<samp>lib%.s=
o lib%.a</samp>=E2=80=99,
which provides the default behavior described above.
</p>
<p>You can turn off link library expansion completely by setting this
variable to an empty value.

<p>A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it
is just a name for a recipe to be executed when you make an explicit
request.  There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a
conflict with a file of the same name, and to improve performance.
</p>
<p>If you write a rule whose recipe will not create the target file, the
recipe will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking.
Here is an example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">clean:
        rm *.o temp
</pre></div>

<p>Because the <code>rm</code> command does not create a file named <samp>c=
lean</samp>,
probably no such file will ever exist.  Therefore, the <code>rm</code> comm=
and
will be executed every time you say =E2=80=98<samp>make clean</samp>=E2=80=
=99.
<span id=3D"index-rm-_0028shell-command_0029-2"></span>
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002ePHONY"></span>
<p>In this example, the <samp>clean</samp> target will not work properly if=
 a
file named <samp>clean</samp> is ever created in this directory.  Since it
has no prerequisites, <samp>clean</samp> would always be considered up to
date and its recipe would not be executed.  To avoid this problem you
can explicitly declare the target to be phony by making it a
prerequisite of the special target <code>.PHONY</code>
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-=
Targets">Special Built-in Target Names</a>) as follows:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.PHONY: clean
clean:
        rm *.o temp
</pre></div>

<p>Once this is done, =E2=80=98<samp>make clean</samp>=E2=80=99 will run th=
e recipe regardless of
whether there is a file named <samp>clean</samp>.
</p>
<p>Prerequisites of <code>.PHONY</code> are always interpreted as literal
target names, never as patterns (even if they contain =E2=80=98<samp>%</sam=
p>=E2=80=99
characters).  To always rebuild a pattern rule consider using a
=E2=80=9Cforce target=E2=80=9D (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software=
/make/manual/make.html#Force-Targets">Rules without Recipes or
Prerequisites</a>).
</p>
<p>Phony targets are also useful in conjunction with recursive
invocations of <code>make</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwa=
re/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>)=
.
In this situation the makefile will often contain a variable which
lists a number of sub-directories to be built.  A simplistic way to
handle this is to define one rule with a recipe that loops over the
sub-directories, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">SUBDIRS =3D foo bar baz

subdirs:
        for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
          $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \
        done
</pre></div>

<p>There are problems with this method, however.  First, any error detected=
 in a
sub-make is ignored by this rule, so it will continue to build the rest of =
the
directories even when one fails.  This can be overcome by adding shell
commands to note the error and exit, but then it will do so even if
<code>make</code> is invoked with the <code>-k</code> option, which is unfo=
rtunate.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, you cannot take full advantage of
<code>make</code>=E2=80=99s ability to build targets in parallel (see <a hr=
ef=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel">Parallel
Execution</a>), since there is only one rule.  Each individual makefile=E2=
=80=99s targets
will be built in parallel, but only one sub-directory will be built at a ti=
me.
</p>
<p>By declaring the sub-directories as <code>.PHONY</code> targets (you mus=
t do
this as the sub-directory obviously always exists; otherwise it won=E2=80=
=99t
be built) you can remove these problems:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">SUBDIRS =3D foo bar baz

.PHONY: subdirs $(SUBDIRS)

subdirs: $(SUBDIRS)

$(SUBDIRS):
        $(MAKE) -C $@

foo: baz
</pre></div>

<p>Here we=E2=80=99ve also declared that the <samp>foo</samp> sub-directory=
 cannot be
built until after the <samp>baz</samp> sub-directory is complete; this kind=
 of
relationship declaration is particularly important when attempting
parallel builds.
</p>
<p>The implicit rule search (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/ma=
ke/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>) is skipped fo=
r
<code>.PHONY</code> targets.  This is why declaring a target as
<code>.PHONY</code> is good for performance, even if you are not worried
about the actual file existing.
</p>
<p>A phony target should not be a prerequisite of a real target file; if it=
 is,
its recipe will be run every time <code>make</code> considers that file.  A=
s long as
a phony target is never a prerequisite of a real target, the phony target
recipe will be executed only when the phony target is a specified goal
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Goals">A=
rguments to Specify the Goals</a>).
</p>
<p>You should not declare an included makefile as phony.  Phony targets are=
 not
intended to represent real files, and because the target is always consider=
ed
out of date make will always rebuild it then re-execute itself
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking=
-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>).  To avoid this,
<code>make</code> will not re-execute itself if an included file marked as =
phony is
re-built.
</p>
<p>Phony targets can have prerequisites.  When one directory contains multi=
ple
programs, it is most convenient to describe all of the programs in one
makefile <samp>./Makefile</samp>.  Since the target remade by default will =
be the
first one in the makefile, it is common to make this a phony target named
=E2=80=98<samp>all</samp>=E2=80=99 and give it, as prerequisites, all the i=
ndividual programs.  For
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all : prog1 prog2 prog3
.PHONY : all

prog1 : prog1.o utils.o
        cc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o

prog2 : prog2.o
        cc -o prog2 prog2.o

prog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o
        cc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o
</pre></div>

<p>Now you can say just =E2=80=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99 to remake all t=
hree programs, or
specify as arguments the ones to remake (as in =E2=80=98<samp>make prog1
prog3</samp>=E2=80=99).  Phoniness is not inherited: the prerequisites of a=
 phony
target are not themselves phony, unless explicitly declared to be so.
</p>
<p>When one phony target is a prerequisite of another, it serves as a subro=
utine
of the other.  For example, here =E2=80=98<samp>make cleanall</samp>=E2=80=
=99 will delete the
object files, the difference files, and the file <samp>program</samp>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.PHONY: cleanall cleanobj cleandiff

cleanall : cleanobj cleandiff
        rm program

cleanobj :
        rm *.o

cleandiff :
        rm *.diff

<p>If a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule
is a nonexistent file, then <code>make</code> imagines this target to have
been updated whenever its rule is run.  This implies that all targets
depending on this one will always have their recipe run.
</p>
<p>An example will illustrate this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">clean: FORCE
        rm $(objects)
FORCE:
</pre></div>

<p>Here the target =E2=80=98<samp>FORCE</samp>=E2=80=99 satisfies the speci=
al conditions, so the
target <samp>clean</samp> that depends on it is forced to run its recipe.
There is nothing special about the name =E2=80=98<samp>FORCE</samp>=E2=80=
=99, but that is one
name commonly used this way.
</p>
<p>As you can see, using =E2=80=98<samp>FORCE</samp>=E2=80=99 this way has =
the same results as using
=E2=80=98<samp>.PHONY: clean</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Using =E2=80=98<samp>.PHONY</samp>=E2=80=99 is more explicit and more ef=
ficient.  However,
other versions of <code>make</code> do not support =E2=80=98<samp>.PHONY</s=
amp>=E2=80=99; thus
=E2=80=98<samp>FORCE</samp>=E2=80=99 appears in many makefiles.  See <a hre=

<p>The <em>empty target</em> is a variant of the phony target; it is used t=
o hold
recipes for an action that you request explicitly from time to time.
Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file=E2=
=80=99s
contents do not matter, and usually are empty.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its
last-modification time, when the rule=E2=80=99s recipe was last executed.  =
It
does so because one of the commands in the recipe is a <code>touch</code>
command to update the target file.
</p>
<p>The empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it
doesn=E2=80=99t make sense).  When you ask to remake the empty target, the
recipe is executed if any prerequisite is more recent than the target;
in other words, if a prerequisite has changed since the last time you
remade the target.  Here is an example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">print: foo.c bar.c
        lpr -p $?
        touch print
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-lpr-_0028shell-command_0029-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-touch-_0028shell-command_0029-1"></span>

<p>With this rule, =E2=80=98<samp>make print</samp>=E2=80=99 will execute t=
he <code>lpr</code> command if
either source file has changed since the last =E2=80=98<samp>make print</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99.  The
automatic variable =E2=80=98<samp>$?</samp>=E2=80=99 is used to print only =
those files that have
changed (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#=

<p>If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <code>.IGNORE</code> say=

ignore errors in execution of recipes for all files.  This usage of
=E2=80=98<samp>.IGNORE</samp>=E2=80=99 is supported only for historical com=
patibility.  Since
this affects every recipe in the makefile, it is not very useful; we
recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in specific
recipes.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=

<dd>
<p>If you specify prerequisites for <code>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</code>,
<code>make</code> assumes that these files are created by commands that
generate low resolution time stamps.  The recipe for the
<code>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</code> target are ignored.
</p>
<p>The high resolution file time stamps of many modern file systems
lessen the chance of <code>make</code> incorrectly concluding that a file
is up to date.  Unfortunately, some hosts do not provide a way to set a
high resolution file time stamp, so commands like =E2=80=98<samp>cp -p</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 that
explicitly set a file=E2=80=99s time stamp must discard its sub-second part=
.
If a file is created by such a command, you should list it as a
prerequisite of <code>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</code> so that <code>make</code>
does not mistakenly conclude that the file is out of date.  For
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME: dst
dst: src
        cp -p src dst
</pre></div>

<p>Since =E2=80=98<samp>cp -p</samp>=E2=80=99 discards the sub-second part =
of <samp>src</samp>=E2=80=99s time
stamp, <samp>dst</samp> is typically slightly older than <samp>src</samp> e=
ven when
it is up to date.  The <code>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</code> line causes
<code>make</code> to consider <samp>dst</samp> to be up to date if its time=
 stamp
is at the start of the same second that <samp>src</samp>=E2=80=99s time sta=
mp is in.
</p>
<p>Due to a limitation of the archive format, archive member time stamps
are always low resolution.  You need not list archive members as
prerequisites of <code>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</code>, as <code>make</code> do=
es this
automatically.

<p>If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <code>.SILENT</code> say=

selective ways to silence specific recipe command lines.

 obsolete way of
defining implicit rules (but a way still widely used).  In principle, any
target name could be special in this way if you break it in two and add
both pieces to the suffix list.  In practice, suffixes normally begin with
=E2=80=98<samp>.</samp>=E2=80=99, so these special target names also begin =
with =E2=80=98<samp>.</samp>=E2=80=99.

<p>When an explicit rule has multiple targets they can be treated in one
of two possible ways: as independent targets or as grouped targets.
The manner in which they are treated is determined by the separator that
appears after the list of targets.
</p>
<span id=3D"Rules-with-Independent-Targets"></span><h4 class=3D"subsubheadi=
ng">Rules with Independent Targets</h4>
<span id=3D"index-independent-targets"></span>
<span id=3D"index-targets_002c-independent"></span>

<p>Rules that use the standard target separator, <code>:</code>, define
independent targets.  This is equivalent to writing the same rule once
for each target, with duplicated prerequisites and recipes.  Typically,
the recipe would use automatic variables such as =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=
=E2=80=99 to specify
which target is being built.
</p>
<p>Rules with independent targets are useful in two cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You want just prerequisites, no recipe.  For example:

<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">kbd.o command.o files.o: command.h
</pre></div>

<p>gives an additional prerequisite to each of the three object files
mentioned.  It is equivalent to writing:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">kbd.o: command.h
command.o: command.h
files.o: command.h
</pre></div>

</li><li> Similar recipes work for all the targets.  The automatic variable
=E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 can be used to substitute the particular =
target to be
remade into the commands (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/=
manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).  For exampl=
e:

<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">bigoutput littleoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) &gt; $@
</pre></div>
<span id=3D"index-subst"></span>

<p>is equivalent to
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">bigoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -big &gt; bigoutput
littleoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -little &gt; littleoutput
</pre></div>

<p>Here we assume the hypothetical program <code>generate</code> makes two
types of output, one if given =E2=80=98<samp>-big</samp>=E2=80=99 and one i=
f given
=E2=80=98<samp>-little</samp>=E2=80=99.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Func=
tions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>,
for an explanation of the <code>subst</code> function.
</p></li></ul>

<p>Suppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the
target, much as the variable =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 allows you t=
o vary the recipe.
You cannot do this with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you
can do it with a <em>static pattern rule</em>.  See <a href=3D"https://www.=
gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Static-Pattern">Static Pattern Rules=
</a>.
</p>
<span id=3D"Rules-with-Grouped-Targets"></span><h4 class=3D"subsubheading">=
Rules with Grouped Targets</h4>
<span id=3D"index-grouped-targets"></span>
<span id=3D"index-targets_002c-grouped"></span>

<p>If instead of independent targets you have a recipe that generates multi=
ple
files from a single invocation, you can express that relationship by declar=
ing
your rule to use <em>grouped targets</em>.  A grouped target rule uses the
separator <code>&amp;:</code> (the =E2=80=98<samp>&amp;</samp>=E2=80=99 her=
e is used to imply =E2=80=9Call=E2=80=9D).
</p>
<p>When <code>make</code> builds any one of the grouped targets, it underst=
ands that
all the other targets in the group are also updated as a result of the
invocation of the recipe.  Furthermore, if only some of the grouped targets
are out of date or missing <code>make</code> will realize that running the =
recipe
will update all of the targets.  Finally, if any of the grouped targets are
out of date, all the grouped targets are considered out of date.
</p>
<p>As an example, this rule defines a grouped target:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo bar biz &amp;: baz boz
        echo $^ &gt; foo
        echo $^ &gt; bar
        echo $^ &gt; biz
</pre></div>

<p>During the execution of a grouped target=E2=80=99s recipe, the automatic
variable =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 is set to the name of the partic=
ular target in the
group which triggered the rule.  Caution must be used if relying on
this variable in the recipe of a grouped target rule.
</p>
<p>Unlike independent targets, a grouped target rule <em>must</em> include
a recipe.  However, targets that are members of a grouped target may
also appear in independent target rule definitions that do not have
recipes.
</p>
<p>Each target may have only one recipe associated with it.  If a grouped
target appears in either an independent target rule or in another
grouped target rule with a recipe, you will get a warning and the
latter recipe will replace the former recipe.  Additionally the target
will be removed from the previous group and appear only in the new
group.
</p>
<p>If you would like a target to appear in multiple groups, then you must
use the double-colon grouped target separator, <code>&amp;::</code> when
declaring all of the groups containing that target.  Grouped
double-colon targets are each considered independently, and each
grouped double-colon rule=E2=80=99s recipe is executed at most once, if at
least one of its multiple targets requires updating.

<p>One file can be the target of several rules.  All the prerequisites
mentioned in all the rules are merged into one list of prerequisites for
the target.  If the target is older than any prerequisite from any rule,
the recipe is executed.
</p>
<p>There can only be one recipe to be executed for a file.  If more than
one rule gives a recipe for the same file, <code>make</code> uses the last
one given and prints an error message.  (As a special case, if the
file=E2=80=99s name begins with a dot, no error message is printed.  This o=
dd
behavior is only for compatibility with other implementations of
<code>make</code>=E2=80=A6 you should avoid using it).  Occasionally it is
useful to have the same target invoke multiple recipes which are
defined in different parts of your makefile; you can use
<em>double-colon rules</em> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/ma=
ke/manual/make.html#Double_002dColon">Double-Colon Rules</a>) for this.
</p>
<p>An extra rule with just prerequisites can be used to give a few extra
prerequisites to many files at once.  For example, makefiles often
have a variable, such as <code>objects</code>, containing a list of all the
compiler output files in the system being made.  An easy way to say
that all of them must be recompiled if <samp>config.h</samp> changes is to
write the following:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D foo.o bar.o
foo.o : defs.h
bar.o : defs.h test.h
$(objects) : config.h
</pre></div>

<p>This could be inserted or taken out without changing the rules that real=
ly
specify how to make the object files, making it a convenient form to use if
you wish to add the additional prerequisite intermittently.
</p>
<p>Another wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be
specified with a variable that you set with a command line argument to
<code>make</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/=
make.html#Overriding">Overriding Variables</a>).  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">extradeps=3D
$(objects) : $(extradeps)
</pre></div>

<p>means that the command =E2=80=98<samp>make extradeps=3Dfoo.h</samp>=E2=
=80=99 will consider
<samp>foo.h</samp> as a prerequisite of each object file, but plain =E2=80=
=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99
will not.
</p>
<p>If none of the explicit rules for a target has a recipe, then <code>make=
</code>
searches for an applicable implicit rule to find one

<p>The <var>targets</var> list specifies the targets that the rule applies =
to.
The targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of
ordinary rules (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=

Names</a>).
</p>
<span id=3D"index-target-pattern_002c-static-_0028not-implicit_0029"></span=

<span id=3D"index-stem"></span>
<p>The <var>target-pattern</var> and <var>prereq-patterns</var> say how to =
compute the
prerequisites of each target.  Each target is matched against the
<var>target-pattern</var> to extract a part of the target name, called the
<em>stem</em>.  This stem is substituted into each of the <var>prereq-patte=
rns</var>
to make the prerequisite names (one from each <var>prereq-pattern</var>).
</p>
<p>Each pattern normally contains the character =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=

<var>target-pattern</var> matches a target, the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=

the target name; this part is called the <em>stem</em>.  The rest of the
pattern must match exactly.  For example, the target <samp>foo.o</samp> mat=
ches
the pattern =E2=80=98<samp>%.o</samp>=E2=80=99, with =E2=80=98<samp>foo</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 as the stem.  The targets
<samp>foo.c</samp> and <samp>foo.out</samp> do not match that pattern.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-prerequisite-pattern_002c-static-_0028not-implicit_0029">=
</span>
<p>The prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the stem
for the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in each prerequisite pattern.  For=
 example, if one
prerequisite pattern is <samp>%.c</samp>, then substitution of the stem
=E2=80=98<samp>foo</samp>=E2=80=99 gives the prerequisite name <samp>foo.c<=
/samp>.  It is legitimate
to write a prerequisite pattern that does not contain =E2=80=98<samp>%</sam=
p>=E2=80=99; then this
prerequisite is the same for all targets.

<p>=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters in pattern rules can be quot=
ed with preceding
backslashes (=E2=80=98<samp>\</samp>=E2=80=99).  Backslashes that would oth=
erwise quote =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99
characters can be quoted with more backslashes.  Backslashes that quote
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters or other backslashes are remove=
d from the pattern
before it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it.
Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=
=99 characters go
unmolested.  For example, the pattern <samp>the\%weird\\%pattern\\</samp> h=
as
=E2=80=98<samp>the%weird\</samp>=E2=80=99 preceding the operative =E2=80=98=
<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 character, and
=E2=80=98<samp>pattern\\</samp>=E2=80=99 following it.  The final two backs=
lashes are left alone
because they cannot affect any =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 character.
</p>
<p>Here is an example, which compiles each of <samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>=
bar.o</samp>
from the corresponding <samp>.c</samp> file:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D foo.o bar.o

all: $(objects)

$(objects): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
</pre></div>

<p>Here =E2=80=98<samp>$&lt;</samp>=E2=80=99 is the automatic variable that=
 holds the name of the
prerequisite and =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 is the automatic variabl=
e that holds the name
of the target; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make=
.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>Each target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is issued
for each target that does not.  If you have a list of files, only some of
which will match the pattern, you can use the <code>filter</code> function =
to
remove non-matching file names (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software=
/make/manual/make.html#Text-Functions">Functions for String Substitution an=
d Analysis</a>):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">files =3D foo.elc bar.o lose.o

$(filter %.o,$(files)): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
$(filter %.elc,$(files)): %.elc: %.el
        emacs -f batch-byte-compile $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>In this example the result of =E2=80=98<samp>$(filter %.o,$(files))</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 is
<samp>bar.o lose.o</samp>, and the first static pattern rule causes each of
these object files to be updated by compiling the corresponding C source
file.  The result of =E2=80=98<samp>$(filter&nbsp;%.elc,$(files))</samp>=E2=
=80=99<!-- /@w --> is
<samp>foo.elc</samp>, so that file is made from <samp>foo.el</samp>.
</p>
<p>Another example shows how to use <code>$*</code> in static pattern rules=
:
<span id=3D"index-_0024_002a_002c-and-static-pattern"></span>
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">bigoutput littleoutput : %output : text.g
        generate text.g -$* &gt; $@
</pre></div>

<p>When the <code>generate</code> command is run, <code>$*</code> will expa=
nd to the
stem, either =E2=80=98<samp>big</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>little</s=

<span id=3D"index-rule_002c-static-pattern-versus-implicit"></span>
<span id=3D"index-static-pattern-rule_002c-versus-implicit"></span>

<p>A static pattern rule has much in common with an implicit rule defined a=
s a
pattern rule (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.=
html#Pattern-Rules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>).
Both have a pattern for the target and patterns for constructing the
names of prerequisites.  The difference is in how <code>make</code> decides
<em>when</em> the rule applies.
</p>
<p>An implicit rule <em>can</em> apply to any target that matches its patte=
rn,
but it <em>does</em> apply only when the target has no recipe otherwise
specified, and only when the prerequisites can be found.  If more than one
implicit rule appears applicable, only one applies; the choice depends on
the order of rules.
</p>
<p>By contrast, a static pattern rule applies to the precise list of target=
s
that you specify in the rule.  It cannot apply to any other target and it
invariably does apply to each of the targets specified.  If two conflicting
rules apply, and both have recipes, that=E2=80=99s an error.
</p>
<p>The static pattern rule can be better than an implicit rule for these
reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You may wish to override the usual implicit rule for a few
files whose names cannot be categorized syntactically but
can be given in an explicit list.

</li><li> If you cannot be sure of the precise contents of the directories
you are using, you may not be sure which other irrelevant files
might lead <code>make</code> to use the wrong implicit rule.  The choice
might depend on the order in which the implicit rule search is done.
With static pattern rules, there is no uncertainty: each rule applies
to precisely the targets specified.
</li></ul>

<p><em>Double-colon</em> rules are explicit rules written with =E2=80=98<sa=
mp>::</samp>=E2=80=99
instead of =E2=80=98<samp>:</samp>=E2=80=99 after the target names.  They a=
re handled
differently from ordinary rules when the same target appears in more
than one rule.  Pattern rules with double-colons have an entirely
different meaning (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/=
make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</a>).
</p>
<p>When a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the same
type: all ordinary, or all double-colon.  If they are double-colon, each
of them is independent of the others.  Each double-colon rule=E2=80=99s rec=
ipe
is executed if the target is older than any prerequisites of that rule.
If there are no prerequisites for that rule, its recipe is always
executed (even if the target already exists).  This can result in
executing none, any, or all of the double-colon rules.
</p>
<p>Double-colon rules with the same target are in fact completely separate
from one another.  Each double-colon rule is processed individually, just
as rules with different targets are processed.
</p>
<p>The double-colon rules for a target are executed in the order they appea=
r
in the makefile.  However, the cases where double-colon rules really make
sense are those where the order of executing the recipes would not matter.
</p>
<p>Double-colon rules are somewhat obscure and not often very useful; they
provide a mechanism for cases in which the method used to update a target
differs depending on which prerequisite files caused the update, and such
cases are rare.
</p>
<p>Each double-colon rule should specify a recipe; if it does not, an
implicit rule will be used if one applies.

<span id=3D"index-automatic-generation-of-prerequisites-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-generating-prerequisites-automatically-1"></span>

<p>In the makefile for a program, many of the rules you need to write often
say only that some object file depends on some header
file.  For example, if <samp>main.c</samp> uses <samp>defs.h</samp> via an
<code>#include</code>, you would write:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">main.o: defs.h
</pre></div>

<p>You need this rule so that <code>make</code> knows that it must remake
<samp>main.o</samp> whenever <samp>defs.h</samp> changes.  You can see that=
 for a
large program you would have to write dozens of such rules in your
makefile.  And, you must always be very careful to update the makefile
every time you add or remove an <code>#include</code>.
<span id=3D"index-_0023include"></span>
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002dM-_0028to-compiler_0029"></span>
<p>To avoid this hassle, most modern C compilers can write these rules for
you, by looking at the <code>#include</code> lines in the source files.
Usually this is done with the =E2=80=98<samp>-M</samp>=E2=80=99 option to t=
he compiler.
For example, the command:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">cc -M main.c
</pre></div>

<p>generates the output:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">main.o : main.c defs.h
</pre></div>

<p>Thus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself.
The compiler will do it for you.
</p>
<p>Note that such a rule constitutes mentioning <samp>main.o</samp> in a
makefile, so it can never be considered an intermediate file by
implicit rule search.  This means that <code>make</code> won=E2=80=99t ever=
 remove
the file after using it; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/m=
anual/make.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit
Rules</a>.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-make-depend"></span>
<p>With old <code>make</code> programs, it was traditional practice to use =
this
compiler feature to generate prerequisites on demand with a command like
=E2=80=98<samp>make depend</samp>=E2=80=99.  That command would create a fi=
le <samp>depend</samp>
containing all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then the
makefile could use <code>include</code> to read them in (see <a href=3D"htt=
ps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include">Including Other Ma=
kefiles</a>).
</p>
<p>In GNU <code>make</code>, the feature of remaking makefiles makes this
practice obsolete=E2=80=94you need never tell <code>make</code> explicitly =
to
regenerate the prerequisites, because it always regenerates any makefile
that is out of date.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manu=
al/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>.
</p>
<p>The practice we recommend for automatic prerequisite generation is to ha=
ve
one makefile corresponding to each source file.  For each source file
<samp><var>name</var>.c</samp> there is a makefile <samp><var>name</var>.d<=
/samp> which lists
what files the object file <samp><var>name</var>.o</samp> depends on.  That=
 way
only the source files that have changed need to be rescanned to produce
the new prerequisites.
</p>
<p>Here is the pattern rule to generate a file of prerequisites (i.e., a ma=
kefile)
called <samp><var>name</var>.d</samp> from a C source file called <samp><va=
r>name</var>.c</samp>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.d: %.c
        @set -e; rm -f $@; \
         $(CC) -M $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; &gt; $@.$$$$; \
         sed 's,\($*\)\.o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' &lt; $@.$$$$ &gt; $@; \
         rm -f $@.$$$$
</pre></div>

<p>See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Patter=
n-Rules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>, for information on defi=
ning pattern rules.  The
=E2=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=99 flag to the shell causes it to exit immed=
iately if the
<code>$(CC)</code> command (or any other command) fails (exits with a
nonzero status).
<span id=3D"index-_002de-_0028shell-flag_0029"></span>
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002dMM-_0028to-GNU-compiler_0029"></span>
<p>With the GNU C compiler, you may wish to use the =E2=80=98<samp>-MM</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 flag instead
of =E2=80=98<samp>-M</samp>=E2=80=99.  This omits prerequisites on system h=
eader files.
See <a data-manual=3D"gcc" href=3D"https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Prepr=
ocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options">Options Controlling the Preproce=
ssor</a> in <cite>Using GNU CC</cite>, for details.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-sed-_0028shell-command_0029"></span>
<p>The purpose of the <code>sed</code> command is to translate (for example=
):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">main.o : main.c defs.h
</pre></div>

<p>into:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">main.o main.d : main.c defs.h
</pre></div>

<p><span id=3D"index-_002ed"></span>
This makes each =E2=80=98<samp>.d</samp>=E2=80=99 file depend on all the so=
urce and header files
that the corresponding =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 file depends on.  =
<code>make</code> then
knows it must regenerate the prerequisites whenever any of the source or
header files changes.
</p>
<p>Once you=E2=80=99ve defined the rule to remake the =E2=80=98<samp>.d</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 files,
you then use the <code>include</code> directive to read them all in.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include">=
Including Other Makefiles</a>.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">sources =3D foo.c bar.c

include $(sources:.c=3D.d)
</pre></div>

<p>(This example uses a substitution variable reference to translate the
list of source files =E2=80=98<samp>foo.c bar.c</samp>=E2=80=99 into a list=
 of prerequisite
makefiles, =E2=80=98<samp>foo.d bar.d</samp>=E2=80=99.  See <a href=3D"http=
s://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Substitution-Refs">Substitut=
ion References</a>, for full
information on substitution references.)  Since the =E2=80=98<samp>.d</samp=
>=E2=80=99 files are
makefiles like any others, <code>make</code> will remake them as necessary
with no further work from you.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software=
/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that the =E2=80=98<samp>.d</samp>=E2=80=99 files contain target def=
initions; you should
be sure to place the <code>include</code> directive <em>after</em> the firs=
t,
default goal in your makefiles or run the risk of having a random
object file become the default goal.

<span id=3D"index-recipe-syntax"></span>

<p>Makefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct
syntaxes in one file.  Most of the makefile uses <code>make</code> syntax
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefile=
s">Writing Makefiles</a>).  However, recipes are meant
to be interpreted by the shell and so they are written using shell
syntax.  The <code>make</code> program does not try to understand shell
syntax: it performs only a very few specific translations on the
content of the recipe before handing it to the shell.
</p>
<p>Each line in the recipe must start with a tab (or the first character
in the value of the <code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable; see <a href=3D"htt=
ps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Sp=
ecial Variables</a>), except that the first recipe line may be attached to =
the
target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between.  <em>Any</em>
line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a =E2=80=9Crule
context=E2=80=9D (that is, after a rule has been started until another rule
or variable definition) will be considered part of a recipe for that
rule.  Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear among the
recipe lines; they are ignored.
</p>
<p>Some consequences of these rules include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it=E2=80=99s an empt=
y
recipe (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#E=
mpty-Recipes">Using Empty Recipes</a>).

</li><li> <span id=3D"index-comments_002c-in-recipes"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recipes_002c-comments-in"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_0023-_0028comments_0029_002c-in-recipes"></span>
A comment in a recipe is not a <code>make</code> comment; it will be
passed to the shell as-is.  Whether the shell treats it as a comment
or not depends on your shell.

</li><li> A variable definition in a =E2=80=9Crule context=E2=80=9D which i=
s indented by a tab
as the first character on the line, will be considered part of a
recipe, not a <code>make</code> variable definition, and passed to the
shell.

</li><li> A conditional expression (<code>ifdef</code>, <code>ifeq</code>,
etc. see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Cond=
itional-Syntax">Syntax of Conditionals</a>) in a =E2=80=9Crule
context=E2=80=9D which is indented by a tab as the first character on the
line, will be considered part of a recipe and be passed to the shell.

<p>One of the few ways in which <code>make</code> does interpret recipes is
checking for a backslash just before the newline.  As in normal
makefile syntax, a single logical recipe line can be split into
multiple physical lines in the makefile by placing a backslash before
each newline.  A sequence of lines like this is considered a single
recipe line, and one instance of the shell will be invoked to run it.
</p>
<p>However, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a
makefile (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=
#Splitting-Lines">Splitting Long Lines</a>),
backslash/newline pairs are <em>not</em> removed from the recipe.  Both
the backslash and the newline characters are preserved and passed to
the shell.  How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your
shell.  If the first character of the next line after the
backslash/newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab by default;
see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-V=
ariables">Other Special Variables</a>), then that character (and only that
character) is removed.  Whitespace is never added to the recipe.
</p>
<p>For example, the recipe for the all target in this makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all :
        @echo no\
space
        @echo no\
        space
        @echo one \
        space
        @echo one\
         space
</pre></div>

<p>consists of four separate shell commands where the output is:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">nospace
nospace
one space
one space
</pre></div>

<p>As a more complex example, this makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all : ; @echo 'hello \
        world' ; echo "hello \
    world"
</pre></div>

<p>will invoke one shell with a command of:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">echo 'hello \
world' ; echo "hello \
    world"
</pre></div>

<p>which, according to shell quoting rules, will yield the following output=
:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">hello \
world
hello     world
</pre></div>

<p>Notice how the backslash/newline pair was removed inside the string
quoted with double quotes (<code>"=E2=80=A6"</code>), but not from the stri=
ng
quoted with single quotes (<code>'=E2=80=A6'</code>).  This is the way the
default shell (<samp>/bin/sh</samp>) handles backslash/newline pairs.  If
you specify a different shell in your makefiles it may treat them
differently.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but
you don=E2=80=99t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted conten=
t.
This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl,
where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning
or even be a syntax error.  One simple way of handling this is to
place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a
<code>make</code> variable then use the variable in the recipe.  In this
situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and
the backslash/newline will be removed.  If we rewrite our example
above using this method:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">HELLO =3D 'hello \
world'

all : ; @echo $(HELLO)
</pre></div>

<p>we will get output like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">hello world
</pre></div>

<p>If you like, you can also use target-specific variables
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Target_0=
02dspecific">Target-specific Variable Values</a>) to obtain
a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that
uses it.

<span id=3D"index-variable-references-in-recipes"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recipes_002c-using-variables-in"></span>

<p>The other way in which <code>make</code> processes recipes is by expandi=
ng
any variable references in them (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwar=
e/make/manual/make.html#Reference">Basics of Variable
References</a>).  This occurs after make has finished reading all the
makefiles and the target is determined to be out of date; so, the
recipes for targets which are not rebuilt are never expanded.
</p>
<p>Variable and function references in recipes have identical syntax and
semantics to references elsewhere in the makefile.  They also have the
same quoting rules: if you want a dollar sign to appear in your
recipe, you must double it (=E2=80=98<samp>$$</samp>=E2=80=99).  For shells=
 like the default
shell, that use dollar signs to introduce variables, it=E2=80=99s important=
 to
keep clear in your mind whether the variable you want to reference is
a <code>make</code> variable (use a single dollar sign) or a shell variable
(use two dollar signs).  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">LIST =3D one two three
all:
        for i in $(LIST); do \
            echo $$i; \
        done
</pre></div>

<p>results in the following command being passed to the shell:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">for i in one two three; do \
    echo $i; \
done
</pre></div>

<p>which generates the expected result:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">one
two
three
</pre></div>

<p>Normally <code>make</code> prints each line of the recipe before it is
executed.  We call this <em>echoing</em> because it gives the appearance
that you are typing the lines yourself.
</p>
<p>When a line starts with =E2=80=98<samp>@</samp>=E2=80=99, the echoing of=
 that line is suppressed.
The =E2=80=98<samp>@</samp>=E2=80=99 is discarded before the line is passed=
 to the shell.
Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
something, such as an <code>echo</code> command to indicate progress throug=
h
the makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">@echo About to make distribution files

<span id=3D"index-_002d_002ddry_002drun"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002drecon"></span>
<p>When <code>make</code> is given the flag =E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=
=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--just-print</samp>=E2=80=99 it
only echoes most recipes, without executing them.  See <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Optio=
ns</a>.  In this case even the recipe lines
starting with =E2=80=98<samp>@</samp>=E2=80=99 are printed.  This flag is u=
seful for finding
out which recipes <code>make</code> thinks are necessary without actually
doing them.

<p>When it is time to execute recipes to update a target, they are
executed by invoking a new sub-shell for each line of the recipe,
unless the <code>.ONESHELL</code> special target is in effect
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#One-Shel=

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> this implies that setting shell variables =
and
invoking shell commands such as <code>cd</code> that set a context local to

put both statements in a single recipe line.  Then <code>make</code> will
invoke one shell to run the entire line, and the shell will execute
the statements in sequence.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo : bar/lose
        cd $(&lt;D) &amp;&amp; gobble $(&lt;F) &gt; ../$@

<p>Here we use the shell AND operator (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) so that if =
the

the <code>gobble</code> command in the wrong directory, which could cause
problems (in this case it would certainly cause <samp>../foo</samp> to be
truncated, at least).

<p>Sometimes you would prefer that all the lines in the recipe be passed
to a single invocation of the shell.  There are generally two
situations where this is useful: first, it can improve performance in
makefiles where recipes consist of many command lines, by avoiding
extra processes.  Second, you might want newlines to be included in
your recipe command (for example perhaps you are using a very
different interpreter as your <code>SHELL</code>).  If the <code>.ONESHELL<=
/code>
special target appears anywhere in the makefile then <em>all</em>
recipe lines for each target will be provided to a single invocation
of the shell.  Newlines between recipe lines will be preserved.  For
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.ONESHELL:
foo : bar/lose
        cd $(&lt;D)
        gobble $(&lt;F) &gt; ../$@
</pre></div>

<p>would now work as expected even though the commands are on different
recipe lines.
</p>
<p>If <code>.ONESHELL</code> is provided, then only the first line of the
recipe will be checked for the special prefix characters (=E2=80=98<samp>@<=
/samp>=E2=80=99,
=E2=80=98<samp>-</samp>=E2=80=99, and =E2=80=98<samp>+</samp>=E2=80=99).  S=
ubsequent lines will include the special
characters in the recipe line when the <code>SHELL</code> is invoked.  If
you want your recipe to start with one of these special characters
you=E2=80=99ll need to arrange for them to not be the first characters on t=
he
first line, perhaps by adding a comment or similar.  For example, this
would be a syntax error in Perl because the first =E2=80=98<samp>@</samp>=
=E2=80=99 is removed
by make:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.ONESHELL:
SHELL =3D /usr/bin/perl
.SHELLFLAGS =3D -e
show :
        @f =3D qw(a b c);
        print "@f\n";
</pre></div>

<p>However, either of these alternatives would work properly:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.ONESHELL:
SHELL =3D /usr/bin/perl
.SHELLFLAGS =3D -e
show :
        # Make sure "@" is not the first character on the first line
        @f =3D qw(a b c);
        print "@f\n";
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.ONESHELL:
SHELL =3D /usr/bin/perl
.SHELLFLAGS =3D -e
show :
        my @f =3D qw(a b c);
        print "@f\n";
</pre></div>

<p>As a special feature, if <code>SHELL</code> is determined to be a
POSIX-style shell, the special prefix characters in =E2=80=9Cinternal=E2=80=
=9D
recipe lines will be <em>removed</em> before the recipe is processed.
This feature is intended to allow existing makefiles to add the
<code>.ONESHELL</code> special target and still run properly without
extensive modifications.  Since the special prefix characters are not
legal at the beginning of a line in a POSIX shell script this is not a
loss in functionality.  For example, this works as expected:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.ONESHELL:
foo : bar/lose
        @cd $(@D)
        @gobble $(@F) &gt; ../$@
</pre></div>

<p>Even with this special feature, however, makefiles with
<code>.ONESHELL</code> will behave differently in ways that could be
noticeable.  For example, normally if any line in the recipe fails,
that causes the rule to fail and no more recipe lines are processed.
Under <code>.ONESHELL</code> a failure of any but the final recipe line wil=
l
not be noticed by <code>make</code>.  You can modify <code>.SHELLFLAGS</cod=
e> to
add the <code>-e</code> option to the shell which will cause any failure
anywhere in the command line to cause the shell to fail, but this
could itself cause your recipe to behave differently.  Ultimately you
may need to harden your recipe lines to allow them to work with
<code>.ONESHELL</code>.

<span id=3D"index-SHELL_002c-value-of"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002eSHELLFLAGS_002c-value-of"></span>

<span id=3D"index-SHELL"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002eSHELLFLAGS"></span>
<p>The program used as the shell is taken from the variable <code>SHELL</co=
de>.
If this variable is not set in your makefile, the program
<samp>/bin/sh</samp> is used as the shell.  The argument(s) passed to the
shell are taken from the variable <code>.SHELLFLAGS</code>.  The default
value of <code>.SHELLFLAGS</code> is <code>-c</code> normally, or <code>-ec=
</code> in
POSIX-conforming mode.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-environment_002c-SHELL-in"></span>
<p>Unlike most variables, the variable <code>SHELL</code> is never set from=
 the
environment.  This is because the <code>SHELL</code> environment variable i=
s
used to specify your personal choice of shell program for interactive
use.  It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect the
functioning of makefiles.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make=
/manual/make.html#Environment">Variables from the
Environment</a>.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, when you do set <code>SHELL</code> in your makefile that va=
lue
is <em>not</em> exported in the environment to recipe lines that
<code>make</code> invokes.  Instead, the value inherited from the user=E2=
=80=99s
environment, if any, is exported.  You can override this behavior by
explicitly exporting <code>SHELL</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org=
/software/make/manual/make.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Vari=
ables to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>), forcing it to be
passed in the environment to recipe lines.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-MAKESHELL-_0028MS_002dDOS-alternative-to-SHELL_0029"></sp=
an>
<p>However, on MS-DOS and MS-Windows the value of <code>SHELL</code> in the
environment <strong>is</strong> used, since on those systems most users do =
not
set this variable, and therefore it is most likely set specifically to
be used by <code>make</code>.  On MS-DOS, if the setting of <code>SHELL</co=
de> is
not suitable for <code>make</code>, you can set the variable
<code>MAKESHELL</code> to the shell that <code>make</code> should use; if s=
et it
will be used as the shell instead of the value of <code>SHELL</code>.
</p>
<span id=3D"Choosing-a-Shell-in-DOS-and-Windows"></span><h4 class=3D"subsub=
heading">Choosing a Shell in DOS and Windows</h4>
<span id=3D"index-shell_002c-in-DOS-and-Windows"></span>
<span id=3D"index-DOS_002c-choosing-a-shell-in"></span>
<span id=3D"index-Windows_002c-choosing-a-shell-in"></span>

<p>Choosing a shell in MS-DOS and MS-Windows is much more complex than on
other systems.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-COMSPEC"></span>
<p>On MS-DOS, if <code>SHELL</code> is not set, the value of the variable
<code>COMSPEC</code> (which is always set) is used instead.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-SHELL_002c-MS_002dDOS-specifics"></span>
<p>The processing of lines that set the variable <code>SHELL</code> in Make=
files
is different on MS-DOS.  The stock shell, <samp>command.com</samp>, is
ridiculously limited in its functionality and many users of <code>make</cod=
e>
tend to install a replacement shell.  Therefore, on MS-DOS, <code>make</cod=
e>
examines the value of <code>SHELL</code>, and changes its behavior based on
whether it points to a Unix-style or DOS-style shell.  This allows
reasonable functionality even if <code>SHELL</code> points to
<samp>command.com</samp>.
</p>
<p>If <code>SHELL</code> points to a Unix-style shell, <code>make</code> on=
 MS-DOS
additionally checks whether that shell can indeed be found; if not, it
ignores the line that sets <code>SHELL</code>.  In MS-DOS, GNU <code>make</=
code>
searches for the shell in the following places:
</p>
<ol>
<li> In the precise place pointed to by the value of <code>SHELL</code>.  F=
or
example, if the makefile specifies =E2=80=98<samp>SHELL =3D /bin/sh</samp>=
=E2=80=99, <code>make</code>
will look in the directory <samp>/bin</samp> on the current drive.

</li><li> In the current directory.

</li><li> In each of the directories in the <code>PATH</code> variable, in =
order.

</li></ol>

<p>In every directory it examines, <code>make</code> will first look for th=
e
specific file (<samp>sh</samp> in the example above).  If this is not found=
,
it will also look in that directory for that file with one of the known
extensions which identify executable files.  For example <samp>.exe</samp>,
<samp>.com</samp>, <samp>.bat</samp>, <samp>.btm</samp>, <samp>.sh</samp>, =
and some others.
</p>
<p>If any of these attempts is successful, the value of <code>SHELL</code> =
will
be set to the full pathname of the shell as found.  However, if none of
these is found, the value of <code>SHELL</code> will not be changed, and th=
us
the line that sets it will be effectively ignored.  This is so
<code>make</code> will only support features specific to a Unix-style shell=
 if
such a shell is actually installed on the system where <code>make</code> ru=
ns.
</p>
<p>Note that this extended search for the shell is limited to the cases
where <code>SHELL</code> is set from the Makefile; if it is set in the
environment or command line, you are expected to set it to the full
pathname of the shell, exactly as things are on Unix.
</p>
<p>The effect of the above DOS-specific processing is that a Makefile that
contains =E2=80=98<samp>SHELL =3D /bin/sh</samp>=E2=80=99 (as many Unix mak=
efiles do), will work
on MS-DOS unaltered if you have e.g. <samp>sh.exe</samp> installed in some
directory along your <code>PATH</code>.

<p>GNU <code>make</code> knows how to execute several recipes at once.  Nor=
mally,
<code>make</code> will execute only one recipe at a time, waiting for it to=
 finish
before executing the next.  However, the =E2=80=98<samp>-j</samp>=E2=80=99 =
or =E2=80=98<samp>--jobs</samp>=E2=80=99 option
tells <code>make</code> to execute many recipes simultaneously.  You can in=
hibit
parallelism for some or all targets from within the makefile (see <a href=
=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel-Disable">Di=
sabling Parallel Execution</a>).
</p>
<p>On MS-DOS, the =E2=80=98<samp>-j</samp>=E2=80=99 option has no effect, s=
ince that system doesn=E2=80=99t
support multi-processing.
</p>
<p>If the =E2=80=98<samp>-j</samp>=E2=80=99 option is followed by an intege=
r, this is the number of
recipes to execute at once; this is called the number of <em>job slots</em>=
.
If there is nothing looking like an integer after the =E2=80=98<samp>-j</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 option,
there is no limit on the number of job slots.  The default number of job
slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).
</p>
<p>Handling recursive <code>make</code> invocations raises issues for paral=
lel
execution.  For more information on this, see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.or=
g/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_002fRecursion">Communicating Optio=
ns to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>.
</p>
<p>If a recipe fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero
status), and errors are not ignored for that recipe (see <a href=3D"https:/=
/www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Errors">Errors in Recipes</a>),=
 the remaining recipe lines to remake the same
target will not be run.  If a recipe fails and the =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=
=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--keep-going</samp>=E2=80=99 option was not given (see <a hr=
ef=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">S=
ummary of Options</a>), <code>make</code> aborts execution.  If make
terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes
running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.

<p>When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer j=
obs
than when it is lightly loaded.  You can use the =E2=80=98<samp>-l</samp>=
=E2=80=99 option to tell
<code>make</code> to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the =
load
average.  The =E2=80=98<samp>-l</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--max-loa=
d</samp>=E2=80=99
option is followed by a floating-point number.  For
example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">-l 2.5
</pre></div>

<p>will not let <code>make</code> start more than one job if the load avera=
ge is
above 2.5.  The =E2=80=98<samp>-l</samp>=E2=80=99 option with no following =
number removes the
load limit, if one was given with a previous =E2=80=98<samp>-l</samp>=E2=80=
=99 option.
</p>
<p>More precisely, when <code>make</code> goes to start up a job, and it al=
ready has
at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not
lower than the limit given with =E2=80=98<samp>-l</samp>=E2=80=99, <code>ma=
ke</code> waits until the load
average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.
</p>
<p>By default, there is no load limit.

.4.1 Disabling Parallel Execution</h4>
<span id=3D"index-disabling-parallel-execution"></span>
<span id=3D"index-parallel-execution_002c-disabling"></span>

<p>If a makefile completely and accurately defines the dependency relations=
hips
between all of its targets, then <code>make</code> will correctly build the=
 goals
regardless of whether parallel execution is enabled or not.  This is the id=
eal
way to write makefiles.
</p>
<p>However, sometimes some or all of the targets in a makefile cannot be ex=
ecuted
in parallel and it=E2=80=99s not feasible to add the prerequisites needed t=
o inform
<code>make</code>.  In that case the makefile can use various methods to di=
sable
parallel execution.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eNOTPARALLEL-special-target"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002eNOTPARALLEL-1"></span>
<p>If the <code>.NOTPARALLEL</code> special target with no prerequisites is=
 specified
anywhere then the entire instance of <code>make</code> will be run serially=
,
regardless of the parallel setting.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all: one two three
one two three: ; @sleep 1; echo $@

.NOTPARALLEL:
</pre></div>

<p>Regardless of how <code>make</code> is invoked, the targets <samp>one</s=
amp>, <samp>two</samp>,
and <samp>three</samp> will be run serially.
</p>
<p>If the <code>.NOTPARALLEL</code> special target has prerequisites, then =
each of
those prerequisites will be considered a target and all prerequisites of th=
ese
targets will be run serially.  Note that only when building this target wil=
l
the prerequisites be run serially: if some other target lists the same
prerequisites and is not in <code>.NOTPARALLEL</code> then these prerequisi=
tes may
be run in parallel.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all: base notparallel

base: one two three
notparallel: one two three

one two three: ; @sleep 1; echo $@

.NOTPARALLEL: notparallel
</pre></div>

<p>Here =E2=80=98<samp>make -j base</samp>=E2=80=99 will run the targets <s=
amp>one</samp>, <samp>two</samp>, and
<samp>three</samp> in parallel, while =E2=80=98<samp>make -j notparallel</s=
amp>=E2=80=99 will run them
serially.  If you run =E2=80=98<samp>make -j all</samp>=E2=80=99 then they =
<em>will</em> be run in
parallel since <samp>base</samp> lists them as prerequisites and is not ser=
ialized.
</p>
<p>The <code>.NOTPARALLEL</code> target should not have commands.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eWAIT-special-target"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002eWAIT"></span>
<p>Finally you can control the serialization of specific prerequisites in a
fine-grained way using the <code>.WAIT</code> special target.  When this ta=
rget
appears in a prerequisite list and parallel execution is enabled, <code>mak=
e</code>
will not build any of the prerequisites to the <em>right</em> of <code>.WAI=
T</code>
until all prerequisites to the <em>left</em> of <code>.WAIT</code> have com=
pleted.
For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all: one two .WAIT three
one two three: ; @sleep 1; echo $@
</pre></div>

<p>If parallel execution is enabled, <code>make</code> will try to build <s=
amp>one</samp> and
<samp>two</samp> in parallel but will not try to build <samp>three</samp> u=
ntil both are
complete.
</p>
<p>As with targets provided to <code>.NOTPARALLEL</code>, <code>.WAIT</code=
> takes effect
only when building the target in whose prerequisite list it appears.  If th=
e
same prerequisites are present in other targets, without <code>.WAIT</code>=
, then
they may still be run in parallel.  Because of this, neither
<code>.NOTPARALLEL</code> with targets nor <code>.WAIT</code> are as reliab=
le for
controlling parallel execution as defining a prerequisite relationship.
However they are easy to use and may be sufficient in less complex situatio=
ns.
</p>
<p>The <code>.WAIT</code> prerequisite will not be present in any of the au=
tomatic
variables for the rule.
</p>
<p>You can create an actual target <code>.WAIT</code> in your makefile for =
portability
but this is not required to use this feature.  If a <code>.WAIT</code> targ=
et is
created it should not have prerequisites or commands.
</p>
<p>The <code>.WAIT</code> feature is also implemented in other versions of =
<code>make</code>
and it=E2=80=99s specified in the POSIX standard for <code>make</code>.

<span id=3D"index-output-during-parallel-execution"></span>
<span id=3D"index-parallel-execution_002c-output-during"></span>

<p>When running several recipes in parallel the output from each
recipe appears as soon as it is generated, with the result that
messages from different recipes may be interspersed, sometimes even
appearing on the same line.  This can make reading the output very
difficult.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002doutput_002dsync"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002dO"></span>
<p>To avoid this you can use the =E2=80=98<samp>--output-sync</samp>=E2=80=
=99 (=E2=80=98<samp>-O</samp>=E2=80=99) option.
This option instructs <code>make</code> to save the output from the command=
s
it invokes and print it all once the commands are completed.
Additionally, if there are multiple recursive <code>make</code> invocations
running in parallel, they will communicate so that only one of them is
generating output at a time.
</p>
<p>If working directory printing is enabled (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu=
.org/software/make/manual/make.html#g_t_002dw-Option">The
=E2=80=98<samp>--print-directory</samp>=E2=80=99 Option</a>), the enter/lea=
ve messages are
printed around each output grouping.  If you prefer not to see these
messages add the =E2=80=98<samp>--no-print-directory</samp>=E2=80=99 option=
 to <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>.
</p>
<p>There are four levels of granularity when synchronizing output,
specified by giving an argument to the option (e.g.,  =E2=80=98<samp>-Oline=
</samp>=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--output-sync=3Drecurse</samp>=E2=80=99).
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt><span><code>none</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the default: all output is sent directly as it is generated =
and
no synchronization is performed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>line</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Output from each individual line of the recipe is grouped and printe=
d
as soon as that line is complete.  If a recipe consists of multiple
lines, they may be interspersed with lines from other recipes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>target</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped and printed
once the target is complete.  This is the default if the
<code>--output-sync</code> or <code>-O</code> option is given with no argum=
ent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>recurse</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Output from each recursive invocation of <code>make</code> is groupe=
d and
printed once the recursive invocation is complete.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Regardless of the mode chosen, the total build time will be the same.
The only difference is in how the output appears.
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=98<samp>target</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>recurse</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 modes both collect the output of
the entire recipe of a target and display it uninterrupted when the
recipe completes.  The difference between them is in how recipes that
contain recursive invocations of <code>make</code> are treated
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursio=
n">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>).  For all recipes
which have no recursive lines, the =E2=80=98<samp>target</samp>=E2=80=99 an=
d =E2=80=98<samp>recurse</samp>=E2=80=99
modes behave identically.
</p>
<p>If the =E2=80=98<samp>recurse</samp>=E2=80=99 mode is chosen, recipes th=
at contain recursive
<code>make</code> invocations are treated the same as other targets: the
output from the recipe, including the output from the recursive
<code>make</code>, is saved and printed after the entire recipe is complete=
.
This ensures output from all the targets built by a given recursive
<code>make</code> instance are grouped together, which may make the output
easier to understand.  However it also leads to long periods of time
during the build where no output is seen, followed by large bursts of
output.  If you are not watching the build as it proceeds, but instead
viewing a log of the build after the fact, this may be the best option
for you.
</p>
<p>If you are watching the output, the long gaps of quiet during the
build can be frustrating.  The =E2=80=98<samp>target</samp>=E2=80=99 output=
 synchronization
mode detects when <code>make</code> is going to be invoked recursively,
using the standard methods, and it will not synchronize the output of
those lines.  The recursive <code>make</code> will perform the
synchronization for its targets and the output from each will be
displayed immediately when it completes.  Be aware that output from
recursive lines of the recipe are not synchronized (for example if
the recursive line prints a message before running <code>make</code>, that
message will not be synchronized).
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=98<samp>line</samp>=E2=80=99 mode can be useful for front-end=
s that are watching
the output of <code>make</code> to track when recipes are started and
completed.
</p>
<p>Some programs invoked by <code>make</code> may behave differently if the=
y
determine they=E2=80=99re writing output to a terminal versus a file (often
described as =E2=80=9Cinteractive=E2=80=9D vs. =E2=80=9Cnon-interactive=E2=
=80=9D modes).  For
example, many programs that can display colorized output will not do
so if they determine they are not writing to a terminal.  If your
makefile invokes a program like this then using the output
synchronization options will cause the program to believe it=E2=80=99s runn=
ing
in =E2=80=9Cnon-interactive=E2=80=9D mode even though the output will ultim=
ately go
to the terminal.

<span id=3D"index-standard-input"></span>

<p>Two processes cannot both take input from the same device at the same
time.  To make sure that only one recipe tries to take input from the
terminal at once, <code>make</code> will invalidate the standard input
streams of all but one running recipe.  If another recipe attempts to
read from standard input it will usually incur a fatal error (a
=E2=80=98<samp>Broken pipe</samp>=E2=80=99 signal).
<span id=3D"index-broken-pipe"></span>
</p>
<p>It is unpredictable which recipe will have a valid standard input stream
(which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard
input of <code>make</code>).  The first recipe run will always get it first=
, and
the first recipe started after that one finishes will get it next, and so
on.
</p>
<p>We will change how this aspect of <code>make</code> works if we find a b=
etter
alternative.  In the mean time, you should not rely on any recipe using
standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but
if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in
all recipes.

<span id=3D"index-recipes_002c-errors-in"></span>
<span id=3D"index-exit-status-_0028errors_0029"></span>

<p>After each shell invocation returns, <code>make</code> looks at its exit
status.  If the shell completed successfully (the exit status is
zero), the next line in the recipe is executed in a new shell; after
the last line is finished, the rule is finished.
</p>
<p>If there is an error (the exit status is nonzero), <code>make</code> giv=
es up on
the current rule, and perhaps on all rules.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the failure of a certain recipe line does not indicate a probl=
em.
For example, you may use the <code>mkdir</code> command to ensure that a
directory exists.  If the directory already exists, <code>mkdir</code> will
report an error, but you probably want <code>make</code> to continue regard=
less.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002d-_0028in-recipes_0029"></span>
<p>To ignore errors in a recipe line, write a =E2=80=98<samp>-</samp>=E2=80=
=99 at the beginning
of the line=E2=80=99s text (after the initial tab).  The =E2=80=98<samp>-</=
samp>=E2=80=99 is discarded
before the line is passed to the shell for execution.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">clean:
        -rm -f *.o
</pre></div>
<span id=3D"index-rm-_0028shell-command_0029-3"></span>

<p>This causes <code>make</code> to continue even if <code>rm</code> is una=
ble to
remove a file.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002di"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002dignore_002derrors"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002eIGNORE-1"></span>
<p>When you run <code>make</code> with the =E2=80=98<samp>-i</samp>=E2=80=
=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--ignore-errors</samp>=E2=80=99
flag, errors are ignored in all recipes of all rules.  A rule in the
makefile for the special target <code>.IGNORE</code> has the same effect, i=
f
there are no prerequisites.  This is less flexible but sometimes useful.
</p>
<p>When errors are to be ignored, because of either a =E2=80=98<samp>-</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 or the
=E2=80=98<samp>-i</samp>=E2=80=99 flag, <code>make</code> treats an error r=
eturn just like success,
except that it prints out a message that tells you the status code
the shell exited with, and says that the error has been ignored.
</p>
<p>When an error happens that <code>make</code> has not been told to ignore=
,
it implies that the current target cannot be correctly remade, and neither
can any other that depends on it either directly or indirectly.  No further
recipes will be executed for these targets, since their preconditions
have not been achieved.
</p>

<span id=3D"index-_002dk"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002dkeep_002dgoing"></span>
<p>Normally <code>make</code> gives up immediately in this circumstance, re=
turning a
nonzero status.  However, if the =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=
=80=98<samp>--keep-going</samp>=E2=80=99
flag is specified, <code>make</code>
continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets,
remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.
For example, after an error in compiling one object file, =E2=80=98<samp>ma=
ke -k</samp>=E2=80=99
will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows
that linking them will be impossible.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/s=
oftware/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>.
</p>
<p>The usual behavior assumes that your purpose is to get the specified
targets up to date; once <code>make</code> learns that this is impossible, =
it
might as well report the failure immediately.  The =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=
=E2=80=99 option says
that the real purpose is to test as many of the changes made in the
program as possible, perhaps to find several independent problems so
that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This
is why Emacs=E2=80=99 <code>compile</code> command passes the =E2=80=98<sam=
p>-k</samp>=E2=80=99 flag by
default.

<span id=3D"index-target_002c-deleting-on-error"></span>
<p>Usually when a recipe line fails, if it has changed the target file at a=
ll,
the file is corrupted and cannot be used=E2=80=94or at least it is not
completely updated.  Yet the file=E2=80=99s time stamp says that it is now =
up to
date, so the next time <code>make</code> runs, it will not try to update th=
at
file.  The situation is just the same as when the shell is killed by a
signal; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#I=
nterrupts">Interrupting or Killing <code>make</code></a>.  So generally the=
 right thing to do is to
delete the target file if the recipe fails after beginning to change
the file.  <code>make</code> will do this if <code>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</code> =
appears
as a target.  This is almost always what you want <code>make</code> to do, =
but
it is not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly
request it.

<p>If <code>make</code> gets a fatal signal while a shell is executing, it =
may
delete the target file that the recipe was supposed to update.  This is
done if the target file=E2=80=99s last-modification time has changed since
<code>make</code> first checked it.
</p>
<p>The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade fro=
m
scratch when <code>make</code> is next run.  Why is this?  Suppose you type
<kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an
object file <samp>foo.o</samp>.  The <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> kills the compiler, =
resulting
in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source
file <samp>foo.c</samp>.  But <code>make</code> also receives the <kbd>Ctrl=
-c</kbd> signal
and deletes this incomplete file.  If <code>make</code> did not do this, th=
e next
invocation of <code>make</code> would think that <samp>foo.o</samp> did not=
 require
updating=E2=80=94resulting in a strange error message from the linker when =
it
tries to link an object file half of which is missing.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002ePRECIOUS-1"></span>
<p>You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the
special target <code>.PRECIOUS</code> depend on it.  Before remaking a targ=
et,
<code>make</code> checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of
<code>.PRECIOUS</code>, and thereby decides whether the target should be de=
leted
if a signal happens.  Some reasons why you might do this are that the
target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a
modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all
times to prevent other sorts of trouble.
</p>
<p>Although <code>make</code> does its best to clean up there are certain s=
ituations
in which cleanup is impossible.  For example, <code>make</code> may be kill=
ed by
an uncatchable signal.  Or, one of the programs make invokes may be killed
or crash, leaving behind an up-to-date but corrupt target file: <code>make<=
/code>
will not realize that this failure requires the target to be cleaned.  Or
<code>make</code> itself may encounter a bug and crash.
</p>
<p>For these reasons it=E2=80=99s best to write <em>defensive recipes</em>,=
 which won=E2=80=99t
leave behind corrupted targets even if they fail.  Most commonly these
recipes create temporary files rather than updating the target directly,
then rename the temporary file to the final target name.  Some compilers
already behave this way, so that you don=E2=80=99t need to write a defensiv=
e recipe.

ve Use of <code>make</code></h3>
<span id=3D"index-recursion"></span>
<span id=3D"index-subdirectories_002c-recursion-for"></span>

<p>Recursive use of <code>make</code> means using <code>make</code> as a co=
mmand in a
makefile.  This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for
various subsystems that compose a larger system.  For example, suppose you
have a sub-directory <samp>subdir</samp> which has its own makefile, and yo=
u would
like the containing directory=E2=80=99s makefile to run <code>make</code> o=
n the
sub-directory.  You can do it by writing this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">subsystem:
        cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)
</pre></div>

<p>or, equivalently, this (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make=
/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">subsystem:
        $(MAKE) -C subdir
</pre></div>
<span id=3D"index-_002dC"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002ddirectory"></span>

<p>You can write recursive <code>make</code> commands just by copying this =
example,
but there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about
how the sub-<code>make</code> relates to the top-level <code>make</code>.  =
You may
also find it useful to declare targets that invoke recursive
<code>make</code> commands as =E2=80=98<samp>.PHONY</samp>=E2=80=99 (for mo=
re discussion on when
this is useful, see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>).
</p>
<span id=3D"index-CURDIR"></span>
<p>For your convenience, when GNU <code>make</code> starts (after it has
processed any <code>-C</code> options) it sets the variable <code>CURDIR</c=
ode> to
the pathname of the current working directory.  This value is never
touched by <code>make</code> again: in particular note that if you include
files from other directories the value of <code>CURDIR</code> does not
change.  The value has the same precedence it would have if it were
set in the makefile (by default, an environment variable <code>CURDIR</code=
>
will not override this value).  Note that setting this variable has no
impact on the operation of <code>make</code> (it does not cause <code>make<=
/code>
to change its working directory, for example).

7.1 How the <code>MAKE</code> Variable Works</h4>
<span id=3D"index-MAKE"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-and-MAKE-variable"></span>

<p>Recursive <code>make</code> commands should always use the variable <cod=
e>MAKE</code>,
not the explicit command name =E2=80=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99, as shown=
 here:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">subsystem:
        cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)
</pre></div>

<p>The value of this variable is the file name with which <code>make</code>=
 was
invoked.  If this file name was <samp>/bin/make</samp>, then the recipe exe=
cuted
is =E2=80=98<samp>cd subdir &amp;&amp; /bin/make</samp>=E2=80=99.  If you u=
se a special version of
<code>make</code> to run the top-level makefile, the same special version w=
ill be
executed for recursive invocations.
<span id=3D"index-cd-_0028shell-command_0029-1"></span>
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002b_002c-and-recipes"></span>
<p>As a special feature, using the variable <code>MAKE</code> in the recipe=
 of
a rule alters the effects of the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 (=E2=80=
=98<samp>--touch</samp>=E2=80=99), =E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=99
(=E2=80=98<samp>--just-print</samp>=E2=80=99), or =E2=80=98<samp>-q</samp>=
=E2=80=99 (=E2=80=98<samp><span class=3D"nolinebreak">--question</span></sa=
mp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->) option.
Using the <code>MAKE</code> variable has the same effect as using a =E2=80=
=98<samp>+</samp>=E2=80=99
character at the beginning of the recipe line.  See <a href=3D"https://www.=
gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Exe=
cuting the Recipes</a>.  This special feature
is only enabled if the <code>MAKE</code> variable appears directly in the
recipe: it does not apply if the <code>MAKE</code> variable is referenced
through expansion of another variable.  In the latter case you must
use the =E2=80=98<samp>+</samp>=E2=80=99 token to get these special effects=
.
</p>
<p>Consider the command =E2=80=98<samp>make -t</samp>=E2=80=99 in the above=
 example.  (The
=E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 option marks targets as up to date withou=
t actually running
any recipes; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>.)  Following the=
 usual
definition of =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99, a =E2=80=98<samp>make -t</=
samp>=E2=80=99 command in the example would
create a file named <samp>subsystem</samp> and do nothing else.  What you
really want it to do is run =E2=80=98<samp>cd&nbsp;subdir&nbsp;&amp;&amp;<!=
-- /@w --> make&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebreak">-t</span><!-- /@w --></sam=
p>=E2=80=99; but
that would require executing the recipe, and =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=
=99 says not to
execute recipes.
<span id=3D"index-_002dt_002c-and-recursion"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-and-_002dt"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002dtouch_002c-and-recursion"></span>
</p>
<p>The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a recipe
line of a rule contains the variable <code>MAKE</code>, the flags =E2=80=98=
<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99,
=E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>-q</samp>=E2=80=99 do =
not apply to that line.  Recipe lines
containing <code>MAKE</code> are executed normally despite the presence of =
a
flag that causes most recipes not to be run.  The usual
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> mechanism passes the flags to the sub-<code>make</co=
de>
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_=
002fRecursion">Communicating Options to a
Sub-<code>make</code></a>), so your request to touch the files, or print th=
e
recipes, is propagated to the subsystem.

<p>Variable values of the top-level <code>make</code> can be passed to the
sub-<code>make</code> through the environment by explicit request.  These
variables are defined in the sub-<code>make</code> as defaults, but they do
not override variables defined in the makefile used by
the sub-<code>make</code> unless you use the =E2=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=
=99 switch (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.ht=
ml#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>).
</p>
<p>To pass down, or <em>export</em>, a variable, <code>make</code> adds the
variable and its value to the environment for running each line of the
recipe.  The sub-<code>make</code>, in turn, uses the environment to
initialize its table of variable values.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.or=
g/software/make/manual/make.html#Environment">Variables from the Environmen=
t</a>.
</p>
<p>Except by explicit request, <code>make</code> exports a variable only if=
 it
is either defined in the environment initially, or if set on the command
line and its name consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-SHELL_002c-exported-value"></span>
<p>The value of the <code>make</code> variable <code>SHELL</code> is not ex=
ported.
Instead, the value of the <code>SHELL</code> variable from the invoking
environment is passed to the sub-<code>make</code>.  You can force
<code>make</code> to export its value for <code>SHELL</code> by using the
<code>export</code> directive, described below.  See <a href=3D"https://www=
.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Choosing-the-Shell">Choosing the Sh=
ell</a>.
</p>
<p>The special variable <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> is always exported (unless y=
ou
unexport it).  <code>MAKEFILES</code> is exported if you set it to anything=
.
</p>
<p><code>make</code> automatically passes down variable values that were de=
fined
on the command line, by putting them in the <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> variable=
.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_0=
02fRecursion">Communicating Options to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>.
</p>
<p>Variables are <em>not</em> normally passed down if they were created by
default by <code>make</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/m=
ake/manual/make.html#Implicit-Variables">Variables Used by
Implicit Rules</a>).  The sub-<code>make</code> will define these for
itself.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-export"></span>
<p>If you want to export specific variables to a sub-<code>make</code>, use=
 the
<code>export</code> directive, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export <var>variable</var> =E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p><span id=3D"index-unexport"></span>
If you want to <em>prevent</em> a variable from being exported, use the
<code>unexport</code> directive, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">unexport <var>variable</var> =E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p>In both of these forms, the arguments to <code>export</code> and
<code>unexport</code> are expanded, and so could be variables or functions
which expand to a (list of) variable names to be (un)exported.
</p>
<p>As a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same
time by doing:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export <var>variable</var> =3D value
</pre></div>

<p>has the same result as:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>variable</var> =3D value
export <var>variable</var>
</pre></div>

<p>and
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export <var>variable</var> :=3D value
</pre></div>

<p>has the same result as:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>variable</var> :=3D value
export <var>variable</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export <var>variable</var> +=3D value
</pre></div>

<p>is just like:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>variable</var> +=3D value
export <var>variable</var>
</pre></div>

<p>See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Append=
ing">Appending More Text to Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>You may notice that the <code>export</code> and <code>unexport</code> di=
rectives
work in <code>make</code> in the same way they work in the shell, <code>sh<=
/code>.
</p>
<p>If you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use
<code>export</code> by itself:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export
</pre></div>

<p>This tells <code>make</code> that variables which are not explicitly men=
tioned in an
<code>export</code> or <code>unexport</code> directive should be exported. =
 Any variable
given in an <code>unexport</code> directive will still <em>not</em> be expo=
rted.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eEXPORT_005fALL_005fVARIABLES-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-compatibility-in-exporting"></span>
<p>The behavior elicited by an <code>export</code> directive by itself was =
the default
in older versions of GNU <code>make</code>.  If your makefiles depend on th=
is
behavior and you want to be compatible with old versions of <code>make</cod=
e>, you
can add the special target <code>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</code> to your makef=
ile
instead of using the <code>export</code> directive.  This will be ignored b=
y old
<code>make</code>s, while the <code>export</code> directive will cause a sy=
ntax
error.
</p>
<p>When using <code>export</code> by itself or <code>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES<=
/code> to export
variables by default, only variables whose names consist solely of
alphanumerics and underscores will be exported.  To export other variables =
you
must specifically mention them in an <code>export</code> directive.
</p>
<p>Adding a variable=E2=80=99s value to the environment requires it to be e=
xpanded.  If
expanding a variable has side-effects (such as the <code>info</code> or <co=
de>eval</code>
or similar functions) then these side-effects will be seen every time a
command is invoked.  You can avoid this by ensuring that such variables hav=
e
names which are not exportable by default.  However, a better solution is t=
o
<em>not</em> use this =E2=80=9Cexport by default=E2=80=9D facility at all, =
and instead
explicitly <code>export</code> the relevant variables by name.
</p>
<p>You can use <code>unexport</code> by itself to tell <code>make</code> <e=
m>not</em> to export
variables by default.  Since this is the default behavior, you would only n=
eed
to do this if <code>export</code> had been used by itself earlier (in an in=
cluded
makefile, perhaps).  You <strong>cannot</strong> use <code>export</code> an=
d <code>unexport</code>
by themselves to have variables exported for some recipes and not for other=
s.
The last <code>export</code> or <code>unexport</code> directive that appear=
s by itself
determines the behavior for the entire run of <code>make</code>.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-MAKELEVEL"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-level-of"></span>
<p>As a special feature, the variable <code>MAKELEVEL</code> is changed whe=
n it
is passed down from level to level.  This variable=E2=80=99s value is a str=
ing
which is the depth of the level as a decimal number.  The value is
=E2=80=98<samp>0</samp>=E2=80=99 for the top-level <code>make</code>; =E2=
=80=98<samp>1</samp>=E2=80=99 for a sub-<code>make</code>,
=E2=80=98<samp>2</samp>=E2=80=99 for a sub-sub-<code>make</code>, and so on=
.  The incrementation
happens when <code>make</code> sets up the environment for a recipe.
</p>
<p>The main use of <code>MAKELEVEL</code> is to test it in a conditional
directive (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.htm=
l#Conditionals">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</a>); this
way you can write a makefile that behaves one way if run recursively and
another way if run directly by you.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-MAKEFILES-1"></span>
<p>You can use the variable <code>MAKEFILES</code> to cause all sub-<code>m=
ake</code>
commands to use additional makefiles.  The value of <code>MAKEFILES</code> =
is
a whitespace-separated list of file names.  This variable, if defined in
the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then
it serves as a list of extra makefiles for the sub-<code>make</code> to rea=
d
before the usual or specified ones.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/sof=
tware/make/manual/make.html#MAKEFILES-Variable">The
Variable <code>MAKEFILES</code></a>.

<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-and-options"></span>

<span id=3D"index-MAKEFLAGS"></span>
<p>Flags such as =E2=80=98<samp>-s</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>-k</s=
amp>=E2=80=99 are passed automatically to the
sub-<code>make</code> through the variable <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>.  This va=
riable is
set up automatically by <code>make</code> to contain the flag letters that
<code>make</code> received.  Thus, if you do =E2=80=98<samp>make&nbsp;<span=
 class=3D"nolinebreak">-ks</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> then
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> gets the value =E2=80=98<samp>ks</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, every sub-<code>make</code> gets a value for <code>MAK=
EFLAGS</code> in
its environment.  In response, it takes the flags from that value and
processes them as if they had been given as arguments.  See <a href=3D"http=
s://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of =
Options</a>.  This means that, unlike other environment variables,
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> specified in the environment take precedence over
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> specified in the makefile.
</p>
<p>The value of <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> is a possibly empty group of charact=
ers
representing single-letter options that take no argument, followed by a spa=
ce
and any options that take arguments or which have long option names.  If an
option has both single-letter and long options, the single-letter option is
always preferred.  If there are no single-letter options on the command lin=
e,
then the value of <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> starts with a space.

<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-and-command-line-variable-definitions"></s=

<p>Likewise variables defined on the command line are passed to the
sub-<code>make</code> through <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>.  Words in the value o=
f
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> that contain =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, <co=

definitions just as if they appeared on the command line.

<span id=3D"index-recursion_002c-and-_002dj"></span>
<span id=3D"index-job-slots_002c-and-recursion"></span>
<p>The =E2=80=98<samp>-j</samp>=E2=80=99 option is a special case (see <a h=
ref=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel">Paralle=
l Execution</a>).
If you set it to some numeric value =E2=80=98<samp>N</samp>=E2=80=99 and yo=
ur operating system
supports it (most any UNIX system will; others typically won=E2=80=99t), th=
e
parent <code>make</code> and all the sub-<code>make</code>s will communicat=
e to
ensure that there are only =E2=80=98<samp>N</samp>=E2=80=99 jobs running at=
 the same time
between them all.  Note that any job that is marked recursive
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-=
of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>)
doesn=E2=80=99t count against the total jobs (otherwise we could get =E2=80=
=98<samp>N</samp>=E2=80=99
sub-<code>make</code>s running and have no slots left over for any real wor=
k!)
</p>
<p>If your operating system doesn=E2=80=99t support the above communication=
, then
no =E2=80=98<samp>-j</samp>=E2=80=99 is added to <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>, so=
 that sub-<code>make</code>s
run in non-parallel mode.  If the =E2=80=98<samp><span class=3D"nolinebreak=
">-j</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> option were passed down
to sub-<code>make</code>s you would get many more jobs running in parallel
than you asked for.  If you give =E2=80=98<samp>-j</samp>=E2=80=99 with no =
numeric argument,
meaning to run as many jobs as possible in parallel, this is passed
down, since multiple infinities are no more than one.
</p>
<p>If you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the
value of <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>, for example like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">subsystem:
        cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) MAKEFLAGS=3D
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-MAKEOVERRIDES"></span>
<p>The command line variable definitions really appear in the variable
<code>MAKEOVERRIDES</code>, and <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> contains a reference=
 to this
variable.  If you do want to pass flags down normally, but don=E2=80=99t wa=
nt to
pass down the command line variable definitions, you can reset
<code>MAKEOVERRIDES</code> to empty, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">MAKEOVERRIDES =3D
</pre></div>

<p><span id=3D"index-Arg-list-too-long"></span>
<span id=3D"index-E2BIG"></span>
This is not usually useful to do.  However, some systems have a small
fixed limit on the size of the environment, and putting so much
information into the value of <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> can exceed it.  If you
see the error message =E2=80=98<samp>Arg list too long</samp>=E2=80=99, thi=
s may be the problem.
<span id=3D"index-_002ePOSIX-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-POSIX-1"></span>
(For strict compliance with POSIX.2, changing <code>MAKEOVERRIDES</code> do=
es
not affect <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> if the special target =E2=80=98<samp>.POS=
IX</samp>=E2=80=99 appears
in the makefile.  You probably do not care about this.)
</p>
<span id=3D"index-MFLAGS"></span>
<p>A similar variable <code>MFLAGS</code> exists also, for historical
compatibility.  It has the same value as <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> except that=
 it
does not contain the command line variable definitions, and it always
begins with a hyphen unless it is empty (<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> begins with=
 a
hyphen only when it begins with an option that has no single-letter
version, such as =E2=80=98<samp>--warn-undefined-variables</samp>=E2=80=99)=
.  <code>MFLAGS</code> was
traditionally used explicitly in the recursive <code>make</code> command, l=
ike
this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">subsystem:
        cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS)
</pre></div>

<p>but now <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> makes this usage redundant.  If you want =
your
makefiles to be compatible with old <code>make</code> programs, use this
technique; it will work fine with more modern <code>make</code> versions to=
o.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-setting-options-from-environment"></span>
<span id=3D"index-options_002c-setting-from-environment"></span>
<span id=3D"index-setting-options-in-makefiles"></span>
<span id=3D"index-options_002c-setting-in-makefiles"></span>
<p>The <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> variable can also be useful if you want to ha=
ve
certain options, such as =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=99 (see <a href=3D"=
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary=
 of
Options</a>), set each time you run <code>make</code>.  You simply put a va=
lue for
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> in your environment.  You can also set <code>MAKEFLA=
GS</code> in
a makefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for
that makefile.  (Note that you cannot use <code>MFLAGS</code> this way.  Th=
at
variable is set only for compatibility; <code>make</code> does not interpre=
t a
value you set for it in any way.)
</p>
<p>When <code>make</code> interprets the value of <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> (e=
ither from the
environment or from a makefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value
does not already begin with one.  Then it chops the value into words
separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were options given
on the command line (except that =E2=80=98<samp>-C</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=
=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>-h</samp>=E2=80=99,
=E2=80=98<samp>-o</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>-W</samp>=E2=80=99, and t=
heir long-named versions are ignored; and there
is no error for an invalid option).
</p>
<p>If you do put <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> in your environment, you should be =
sure not
to include any options that will drastically affect the actions of
<code>make</code> and undermine the purpose of makefiles and of <code>make<=
/code>
itself.  For instance, the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<sam=
p>-n</samp>=E2=80=99, and =E2=80=98<samp>-q</samp>=E2=80=99 options, if
put in one of these variables, could have disastrous consequences and would
certainly have at least surprising and probably annoying effects.
</p>
<p>If you=E2=80=99d like to run other implementations of <code>make</code> =
in addition
to GNU <code>make</code>, and hence do not want to add GNU
<code>make</code>-specific flags to the <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> variable, yo=
u can
add them to the <code>GNUMAKEFLAGS</code> variable instead.  This variable
is parsed just before <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>, in the same way as
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code>.  When <code>make</code> constructs <code>MAKEFLAGS<=
/code> to
pass to a recursive <code>make</code> it will include all flags, even those
taken from <code>GNUMAKEFLAGS</code>.  As a result, after parsing
<code>GNUMAKEFLAGS</code> GNU <code>make</code> sets this variable to the e=
mpty
string to avoid duplicating flags during recursion.
</p>
<p>It=E2=80=99s best to use <code>GNUMAKEFLAGS</code> only with flags which=
 won=E2=80=99t
materially change the behavior of your makefiles.  If your makefiles
require GNU Make anyway then simply use <code>MAKEFLAGS</code>.  Flags such
as =E2=80=98<samp>--no-print-directory</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--=
output-sync</samp>=E2=80=99 may be
appropriate for <code>GNUMAKEFLAGS</code>.

<span id=3D"Defining-Canned-Recipes"></span><h3 class=3D"section">5.8 Defin=
ing Canned Recipes</h3>
<span id=3D"index-canned-recipes"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recipes_002c-canned"></span>
<span id=3D"index-sequences-of-commands"></span>
<span id=3D"index-commands_002c-sequences-of"></span>

<p>When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various
targets, you can define it as a canned sequence with the <code>define</code=
>
directive, and refer to the canned sequence from the recipes for those
targets.  The canned sequence is actually a variable, so the name must
not conflict with other variable names.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of defining a canned recipe:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">define run-yacc =3D
yacc $(firstword $^)
mv y.tab.c $@
endef
</pre></div>
<span id=3D"index-yacc"></span>

<p>Here <code>run-yacc</code> is the name of the variable being defined;
<code>endef</code> marks the end of the definition; the lines in between ar=
e the
commands.  The <code>define</code> directive does not expand variable refer=
ences
and function calls in the canned sequence; the =E2=80=98<samp>$</samp>=E2=
=80=99 characters,
parentheses, variable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the
variable you are defining.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multi_002=
dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>,
for a complete explanation of <code>define</code>.
</p>
<p>The first command in this example runs Yacc on the first prerequisite of
whichever rule uses the canned sequence.  The output file from Yacc is
always named <samp>y.tab.c</samp>.  The second command moves the output to =
the
rule=E2=80=99s target file name.
</p>
<p>To use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the recipe of a
rule.  You can substitute it like any other variable
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Referenc=
e">Basics of Variable References</a>).
Because variables defined by <code>define</code> are recursively expanded
variables, all the variable references you wrote inside the <code>define</c=
ode>
are expanded now.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.c : foo.y
        $(run-yacc)
</pre></div>

<p>=E2=80=98<samp>foo.y</samp>=E2=80=99 will be substituted for the variabl=
e =E2=80=98<samp>$^</samp>=E2=80=99 when it occurs in
<code>run-yacc</code>=E2=80=99s value, and =E2=80=98<samp>foo.c</samp>=E2=
=80=99 for =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>This is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in
practice because <code>make</code> has an implicit rule to figure out these
commands based on the file names involved
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit=
-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>).
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_0040_002c-and-define"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002c-and-define"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002b_002c-and-define"></span>
<p>In recipe execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as
if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab.  In
particular, <code>make</code> invokes a separate sub-shell for each line.  =
You
can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines
(=E2=80=98<samp>@</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>-</samp>=E2=80=99, and =
=E2=80=98<samp>+</samp>=E2=80=99) on each line of a canned sequence.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recipes">=
Writing Recipes in Rules</a>.
For example, using this canned sequence:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">define frobnicate =3D
@echo "frobnicating target $@"
frob-step-1 $&lt; -o $@-step-1
frob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@
endef
</pre></div>

<p><code>make</code> will not echo the first line, the <code>echo</code> co=
mmand.
But it <em>will</em> echo the following two recipe lines.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, prefix characters on the recipe line that refers to
a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">frob.out: frob.in
        @$(frobnicate)
</pre></div>

<p>does not echo <em>any</em> recipe lines.
(See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Echoing"=
>Recipe Echoing</a>, for a full explanation of =E2=80=98<samp>@</samp>=E2=
=80=99.)

ty Recipes</h3>
<span id=3D"index-empty-recipes"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recipes_002c-empty"></span>

<p>It is sometimes useful to define recipes which do nothing.  This is done
simply by giving a recipe that consists of nothing but whitespace.  For
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">target: ;
</pre></div>

<p>defines an empty recipe for <samp>target</samp>.  You could also use a l=
ine
beginning with a recipe prefix character to define an empty recipe,
but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eDEFAULT_002c-and-empty-recipes"></span>
<p>You may be wondering why you would want to define a recipe that does
nothing.  One reason this is useful is to prevent a target from
getting implicit recipes (from implicit rules or the <code>.DEFAULT</code>
special target; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a> and see <a href=3D"https://=
www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Last-Resort">Defining Last-Resor=
t Default Rules</a>).
</p>
<p>Empty recipes can also be used to avoid errors for targets that will
be created as a side-effect of another recipe: if the target does not
exist the empty recipe ensures that <code>make</code> won=E2=80=99t complai=
n that it
doesn=E2=80=99t know how to build the target, and <code>make</code> will as=
sume the
target is out of date.
</p>
<p>You may be inclined to define empty recipes for targets that are not
actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be
remade.  However, this is not the best way to do that, because the
prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually
does exist.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>, for a better way to
do this.

 Variables</h2>

<span id=3D"index-value"></span>
<span id=3D"index-recursive-variable-expansion"></span>
<span id=3D"index-simple-variable-expansion"></span>

<p>A <em>variable</em> is a name defined in a makefile to represent a strin=
g
of text, called the variable=E2=80=99s <em>value</em>.  These values are
substituted by explicit request into targets, prerequisites, recipes,
and other parts of the makefile.  (In some other versions of <code>make</co=
de>,
variables are called <em>macros</em>.)
<span id=3D"index-macro"></span>
</p>
<p>Variables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when
read, except for in recipes, the right-hand sides of variable
definitions using =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, and the bodies of var=
iable definitions
using the <code>define</code> directive.  The value a variable expands to i=
s
that of its most recent definition at the time of expansion.  In other
words, variables are dynamically scoped.
</p>
<p>Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to compiler=
s,
programs to run, directories to look in for source files, directories to
write output in, or anything else you can imagine.
</p>
<p>A variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing
=E2=80=98<samp>:</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>#</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=
=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, or whitespace.  However, variable names
containing characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores
should be considered carefully, as in some shells they cannot be
passed through the environment to a sub-<code>make</code>
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Variable=
s_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a
Sub-<code>make</code></a>).  Variable names beginning with =E2=80=98<samp>.=
</samp>=E2=80=99 and an
uppercase letter may be given special meaning in future versions of
<code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>Variable names are case-sensitive.  The names =E2=80=98<samp>foo</samp>=
=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>FOO</samp>=E2=80=99,
and =E2=80=98<samp>Foo</samp>=E2=80=99 all refer to different variables.
</p>
<p>It is traditional to use upper case letters in variable names, but we
recommend using lower case letters for variable names that serve internal
purposes in the makefile, and reserving upper case for parameters that
control implicit rules or for parameters that the user should override with
command options (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ma=
ke.html#Overriding">Overriding Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>A few variables have names that are a single punctuation character or
just a few characters.  These are the <em>automatic variables</em>, and
they have particular specialized uses.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/=
software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>=

<span id=3D"index-dollar-sign-_0028_0024_0029_002c-in-variable-reference"><=
/span>

<p>To substitute a variable=E2=80=99s value, write a dollar sign followed b=
y the name
of the variable in parentheses or braces: either =E2=80=98<samp>$(foo)</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>${foo}</samp>=E2=80=99 is a valid reference to the variable =
<code>foo</code>.  This
special significance of =E2=80=98<samp>$</samp>=E2=80=99 is why you must wr=
ite =E2=80=98<samp>$$</samp>=E2=80=99 to have
the effect of a single dollar sign in a file name or recipe.
</p>
<p>Variable references can be used in any context: targets, prerequisites,
recipes, most directives, and new variable values.  Here is an
example of a common case, where a variable holds the names of all the
object files in a program:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D program.o foo.o utils.o
program : $(objects)
        cc -o program $(objects)

$(objects) : defs.h
</pre></div>

<p>Variable references work by strict textual substitution.  Thus, the rule
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo =3D c
prog.o : prog.$(foo)
        $(foo)$(foo) -$(foo) prog.$(foo)
</pre></div>

<p>could be used to compile a C program <samp>prog.c</samp>.  Since spaces =
before
the variable value are ignored in variable assignments, the value of
<code>foo</code> is precisely =E2=80=98<samp>c</samp>=E2=80=99.  (Don=E2=80=
=99t actually write your makefiles
this way!)
</p>
<p>A dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign,
open-parenthesis or open-brace treats that single character as the
variable name.  Thus, you could reference the variable <code>x</code> with
=E2=80=98<samp>$x</samp>=E2=80=99.  However, this practice can lead to conf=
usion (e.g.,
=E2=80=98<samp>$foo</samp>=E2=80=99 refers to the variable <code>f</code> f=
ollowed by the string
<code>oo</code>) so we recommend using parentheses or braces around all
variables, even single-letter variables, unless omitting them gives
significant readability improvements.  One place where readability is
often improved is automatic variables (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/s=
oftware/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>)=

<p>There are different ways that a variable in GNU <code>make</code> can ge=
t a value;
we call them the <em>flavors</em> of variables.  The flavors are distinguis=
hed in
how they handle the values they are assigned in the makefile, and in how th=
ose
values are managed when the variable is later used and expanded.

<span id=3D"index-_003d"></span>
<p>The first flavor of variable is a <em>recursively expanded</em> variable=
.
Variables of this sort are defined by lines using =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=
=E2=80=99
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting"=
>Setting Variables</a>) or by the <code>define</code> directive
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multi_00=
2dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>).  The value you specify
is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables,
these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in
the course of expanding some other string).  When this happens, it is
called <em>recursive expansion</em>.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo =3D $(bar)
bar =3D $(ugh)
ugh =3D Huh?

all:;echo $(foo)
</pre></div>

<p>will echo =E2=80=98<samp>Huh?</samp>=E2=80=99: =E2=80=98<samp>$(foo)</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 expands to =E2=80=98<samp>$(bar)</samp>=E2=80=99 which
expands to =E2=80=98<samp>$(ugh)</samp>=E2=80=99 which finally expands to =
=E2=80=98<samp>Huh?</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>This flavor of variable is the only sort supported by most other
versions of <code>make</code>.  It has its advantages and its disadvantages=
.
An advantage (most would say) is that:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">CFLAGS =3D $(include_dirs) -O
include_dirs =3D -Ifoo -Ibar
</pre></div>

<p>will do what was intended: when =E2=80=98<samp>CFLAGS</samp>=E2=80=99 is=
 expanded in a recipe,
it will expand to =E2=80=98<samp>-Ifoo -Ibar -O</samp>=E2=80=99.  A major d=
isadvantage is that you
cannot append something on the end of a variable, as in
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">CFLAGS =3D $(CFLAGS) -O
</pre></div>

<p>because it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion.
(Actually <code>make</code> detects the infinite loop and reports an error.=
)
<span id=3D"index-loops-in-variable-expansion"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-loops-in-expansion"></span>
</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that any functions
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Function=
s">Functions for Transforming Text</a>)
referenced in the definition will be executed every time the variable is
expanded.  This makes <code>make</code> run slower; worse, it causes the
<code>wildcard</code> and <code>shell</code> functions to give unpredictabl=
e results
because you cannot easily control when they are called, or even how many
times.

<span id=3D"Simply-Expanded-Variable-Assignment"></span><h4 class=3D"subsec=
tion">6.2.2 Simply Expanded Variable Assignment</h4>
<p>To avoid the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded
variables, there is another flavor: simply expanded variables.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-simply-expanded-variables"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-simply-expanded"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_003a_003d"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_003a_003a_003d"></span>
<p><em>Simply expanded variables</em> are defined by lines using =E2=80=98<=
samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99
or =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org=
/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting">Setting Variables</a>).  Both form=
s are
equivalent in GNU <code>make</code>; however only the =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D<=
/samp>=E2=80=99 form is
described by the POSIX standard (support for =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 is added to
the POSIX standard for POSIX Issue 8).
</p>
<p>The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once, expanding any
references to other variables and functions, when the variable is
defined.  Once that expansion is complete the value of the variable is
never expanded again: when the variable is used the value is copied
verbatim as the expansion.  If the value contained variable references
the result of the expansion will contain their values <em>as of the
time this variable was defined</em>.  Therefore,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">x :=3D foo
y :=3D $(x) bar
x :=3D later
</pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">y :=3D foo bar
x :=3D later
</pre></div>

<p>Here is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of
=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 in conjunction with the <code>shell</co=
de> function.
(See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Shell-Fu=
nction">The <code>shell</code> Function</a>.)  This example
also shows use of the variable <code>MAKELEVEL</code>, which is changed
when it is passed down from level to level.
(See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Variable=
s_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a
Sub-<code>make</code></a>, for information about <code>MAKELEVEL</code>.)
</p>
<span id=3D"index-MAKELEVEL-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-MAKE-1"></span>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifeq (0,${MAKELEVEL})
whoami    :=3D $(shell whoami)
host-type :=3D $(shell arch)
MAKE :=3D ${MAKE} host-type=3D${host-type} whoami=3D${whoami}
endif
</pre></div>

<p>An advantage of this use of =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 is that =
a typical
=E2=80=98descend into a directory=E2=80=99 recipe then looks like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">${subdirs}:
        ${MAKE} -C $@ all
</pre></div>

<p>Simply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile programmin=
g
more predictable because they work like variables in most programming
languages.  They allow you to redefine a variable using its own value (or
its value processed in some way by one of the expansion functions) and to
use the expansion functions much more efficiently
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Function=
s">Functions for Transforming Text</a>).
</p>
<span id=3D"index-spaces_002c-in-variable-values"></span>
<span id=3D"index-whitespace_002c-in-variable-values"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-spaces-in-values"></span>
<p>You can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into
variable values.  Leading whitespace characters are discarded from your
input before substitution of variable references and function calls;
this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value by
protecting them with variable references, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">nullstring :=3D
space :=3D $(nullstring) # end of the line
</pre></div>

<p>Here the value of the variable <code>space</code> is precisely one space=
.  The
comment =E2=80=98<samp>#&nbsp;end&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;line</samp>=E2=80=
=99<!-- /@w --> is included here just for clarity.
Since trailing space characters are <em>not</em> stripped from variable
values, just a space at the end of the line would have the same effect
(but be rather hard to read).  If you put whitespace at the end of a
variable value, it is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end
of the line to make your intent clear.  Conversely, if you do <em>not</em>
want any whitespace characters at the end of your variable value, you
must remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after
some whitespace, such as this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">dir :=3D /foo/bar    # directory to put the frobs in
</pre></div>

<p>Here the value of the variable <code>dir</code> is =E2=80=98<samp>/foo/b=
ar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->
(with four trailing spaces), which was probably not the intention.
(Imagine something like =E2=80=98<samp>$(dir)/file</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w =
--> with this definition!)

<p>Another form of assignment allows for immediate expansion, but unlike si=
mple
assignment the resulting variable is recursive: it will be re-expanded agai=
n
on every use.  In order to avoid unexpected results, after the value is
immediately expanded it will automatically be quoted: all instances of
<code>$</code> in the value after expansion will be converted into <code>$$=
</code>.  This
type of assignment uses the =E2=80=98<samp>:::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 operator.=
  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">var =3D first
OUT :::=3D $(var)
var =3D second
</pre></div>

<p>results in the <code>OUT</code> variable containing the text =E2=80=98<s=
amp>first</samp>=E2=80=99, while here:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">var =3D one$$two
OUT :::=3D $(var)
var =3D three$$four
</pre></div>

<p>results in the <code>OUT</code> variable containing the text =E2=80=98<s=
amp>one$$two</samp>=E2=80=99.  The
value is expanded when the variable is assigned, so the result is the
expansion of the first value of <code>var</code>, =E2=80=98<samp>one$two</s=
amp>=E2=80=99; then the value is
re-escaped before the assignment is complete giving the final result of
=E2=80=98<samp>one$$two</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>The variable <code>OUT</code> is thereafter considered a recursive varia=
ble, so it
will be re-expanded when it is used.
</p>
<p>This seems functionally equivalent to the =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 / =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 operators,
but there are a few differences:
</p>
<p>First, after assignment the variable is a normal recursive variable; whe=
n you
append to it with =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 the value on the righ=
t-hand side is not expanded
immediately.  If you prefer the =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 operato=
r to expand the right-hand
side immediately you should use the =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 / =
=E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 assignment instead.
</p>
<p>Second, these variables are slightly less efficient than simply expanded
variables since they do need to be re-expanded when they are used, rather t=
han
merely copied.  However since all variable references are escaped this
expansion simply un-escapes the value, it won=E2=80=99t expand any variable=
s or run
any functions.
</p>
<p>Here is another example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">var =3D one$$two
OUT :::=3D $(var)
OUT +=3D $(var)
var =3D three$$four
</pre></div>

<p>After this, the value of <code>OUT</code> is the text =E2=80=98<samp>one=
$$two $(var)</samp>=E2=80=99.  When
this variable is used it will be expanded and the result will be
=E2=80=98<samp>one$two three$four</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>This style of assignment is equivalent to the traditional BSD <code>make=
</code>
=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 operator; as you can see it works sligh=
tly differently than the GNU
<code>make</code> =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 operator.  The <code>=
:::=3D</code> operator is added to the
POSIX specification in Issue 8 to provide portability.

<p>A <em>substitution reference</em> substitutes the value of a variable wi=
th
alterations that you specify.  It has the form
=E2=80=98<samp>$(<var>var</var>:<var>a</var>=3D<var>b</var>)</samp>=E2=80=
=99 (or
=E2=80=98<samp>${<var>var</var>:<var>a</var>=3D<var>b</var>}</samp>=E2=80=
=99) and its meaning is to take the value
of the variable <var>var</var>, replace every <var>a</var> at the end of a =
word with
<var>b</var> in that value, and substitute the resulting string.
</p>
<p>When we say =E2=80=9Cat the end of a word=E2=80=9D, we mean that <var>a<=
/var> must appear
either followed by whitespace or at the end of the value in order to be
replaced; other occurrences of <var>a</var> in the value are unaltered.  Fo=
r
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo :=3D a.o b.o l.a c.o
bar :=3D $(foo:.o=3D.c)
</pre></div>

<p>sets =E2=80=98<samp>bar</samp>=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98<samp>a.c b.c l.a c.=
c</samp>=E2=80=99.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual=

</p>
<p>A substitution reference is shorthand for the <code>patsubst</code>
expansion function (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual=
/make.html#Text-Functions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</=
a>):
=E2=80=98<samp>$(<var>var</var>:<var>a</var>=3D<var>b</var>)</samp>=E2=80=
=99 is equivalent to
=E2=80=98<samp>$(patsubst %<var>a</var>,%<var>b</var>,<var>var</var>)</samp=

substitution references as well as <code>patsubst</code> for compatibility

<p>Another type of substitution reference lets you use the full power of
the <code>patsubst</code> function.  It has the same form
=E2=80=98<samp>$(<var>var</var>:<var>a</var>=3D<var>b</var>)</samp>=E2=80=
=99 described above, except that now
<var>a</var> must contain a single =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 charact=
er.  This case is
equivalent to =E2=80=98<samp>$(patsubst <var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,$(<var>va=
r</var>))</samp>=E2=80=99.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Func=
tions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>,
for a description of the <code>patsubst</code> function.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo :=3D a.o b.o l.a c.o
bar :=3D $(foo:%.o=3D%.c)
</pre></div>

<p>sets =E2=80=98<samp>bar</samp>=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98<samp>a.c b.c l.a c.=
c</samp>=E2=80=99.

<p>Computed variable names are an advanced concept, very useful in more
sophisticated makefile programming.  In simple situations you need not
consider them, but they can be extremely useful.
</p>
<p>Variables may be referenced inside the name of a variable.  This is
called a <em>computed variable name</em> or a <em>nested variable
reference</em>.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">x =3D y
y =3D z
a :=3D $($(x))
</pre></div>

<p>defines <code>a</code> as =E2=80=98<samp>z</samp>=E2=80=99: the =E2=80=
=98<samp>$(x)</samp>=E2=80=99 inside =E2=80=98<samp>$($(x))</samp>=E2=80=99=
 expands
to =E2=80=98<samp>y</samp>=E2=80=99, so =E2=80=98<samp>$($(x))</samp>=E2=80=
=99 expands to =E2=80=98<samp>$(y)</samp>=E2=80=99 which in turn expands
to =E2=80=98<samp>z</samp>=E2=80=99.  Here the name of the variable to refe=
rence is not stated
explicitly; it is computed by expansion of =E2=80=98<samp>$(x)</samp>=E2=80=
=99.  The reference
=E2=80=98<samp>$(x)</samp>=E2=80=99 here is nested within the outer variabl=
e reference.
</p>
<p>The previous example shows two levels of nesting, but any number of leve=
ls
is possible.  For example, here are three levels:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">x =3D y
y =3D z
z =3D u
a :=3D $($($(x)))
</pre></div>

<p>Here the innermost =E2=80=98<samp>$(x)</samp>=E2=80=99 expands to =E2=80=
=98<samp>y</samp>=E2=80=99, so =E2=80=98<samp>$($(x))</samp>=E2=80=99
expands to =E2=80=98<samp>$(y)</samp>=E2=80=99 which in turn expands to =E2=
=80=98<samp>z</samp>=E2=80=99; now we have
=E2=80=98<samp>$(z)</samp>=E2=80=99, which becomes =E2=80=98<samp>u</samp>=
=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>References to recursively-expanded variables within a variable name are
re-expanded in the usual fashion.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">x =3D $(y)
y =3D z
z =3D Hello
a :=3D $($(x))
</pre></div>

<p>defines <code>a</code> as =E2=80=98<samp>Hello</samp>=E2=80=99: =E2=80=
=98<samp>$($(x))</samp>=E2=80=99 becomes =E2=80=98<samp>$($(y))</samp>=E2=
=80=99
which becomes =E2=80=98<samp>$(z)</samp>=E2=80=99 which becomes =E2=80=98<s=
amp>Hello</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Nested variable references can also contain modified references and func=
tion
invocations (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#Functions">Functions for Transforming Text</a>), just like
any other reference.  For example, using the <code>subst</code> function
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Fun=
ctions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">x =3D variable1
variable2 :=3D Hello
y =3D $(subst 1,2,$(x))
z =3D y
a :=3D $($($(z)))
</pre></div>

<p>eventually defines <code>a</code> as =E2=80=98<samp>Hello</samp>=E2=80=
=99.  It is doubtful that anyone
would ever want to write a nested reference as convoluted as this one, but
it works: =E2=80=98<samp>$($($(z)))</samp>=E2=80=99 expands to =E2=80=98<sa=
mp>$($(y))</samp>=E2=80=99 which becomes
=E2=80=98<samp>$($(subst 1,2,$(x)))</samp>=E2=80=99.  This gets the value =
=E2=80=98<samp>variable1</samp>=E2=80=99 from
<code>x</code> and changes it by substitution to =E2=80=98<samp>variable2</=
samp>=E2=80=99, so that the
entire string becomes =E2=80=98<samp>$(variable2)</samp>=E2=80=99, a simple=
 variable reference
whose value is =E2=80=98<samp>Hello</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>A computed variable name need not consist entirely of a single variable
reference.  It can contain several variable references, as well as some
invariant text.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">a_dirs :=3D dira dirb
1_dirs :=3D dir1 dir2
</pre><pre class=3D"example">
</pre><pre class=3D"example">a_files :=3D filea fileb
1_files :=3D file1 file2
</pre><pre class=3D"example">
</pre><pre class=3D"example">ifeq "$(use_a)" "yes"
a1 :=3D a
else
a1 :=3D 1
endif
</pre><pre class=3D"example">
</pre><pre class=3D"example">ifeq "$(use_dirs)" "yes"
df :=3D dirs
else
df :=3D files
endif

dirs :=3D $($(a1)_$(df))
</pre></div>

<p>will give <code>dirs</code> the same value as <code>a_dirs</code>, <code=
>1_dirs</code>,
<code>a_files</code> or <code>1_files</code> depending on the settings of <=
code>use_a</code>
and <code>use_dirs</code>.
</p>
<p>Computed variable names can also be used in substitution references:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">a_objects :=3D a.o b.o c.o
1_objects :=3D 1.o 2.o 3.o

sources :=3D $($(a1)_objects:.o=3D.c)
</pre></div>

<p>defines <code>sources</code> as either =E2=80=98<samp>a.c b.c c.c</samp>=
=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>1.c 2.c 3.c</samp>=E2=80=99,
depending on the value of <code>a1</code>.
</p>
<p>The only restriction on this sort of use of nested variable references
is that they cannot specify part of the name of a function to be called.
This is because the test for a recognized function name is done before
the expansion of nested references.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifdef do_sort
func :=3D sort
else
func :=3D strip
endif
</pre><pre class=3D"example">
</pre><pre class=3D"example">bar :=3D a d b g q c
</pre><pre class=3D"example">
</pre><pre class=3D"example">foo :=3D $($(func) $(bar))
</pre></div>

<p>attempts to give =E2=80=98<samp>foo</samp>=E2=80=99 the value of the var=
iable =E2=80=98<samp>sort a d b g
q c</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>strip a d b g q c</samp>=E2=80=99, ra=
ther than giving =E2=80=98<samp>a d b g q c</samp>=E2=80=99
as the argument to either the <code>sort</code> or the <code>strip</code> f=
unction.
This restriction could be removed in the future if that change is shown
to be a good idea.
</p>
<p>You can also use computed variable names in the left-hand side of a
variable assignment, or in a <code>define</code> directive, as in:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">dir =3D foo
$(dir)_sources :=3D $(wildcard $(dir)/*.c)
define $(dir)_print =3D
lpr $($(dir)_sources)
endef
</pre></div>

<p>This example defines the variables =E2=80=98<samp>dir</samp>=E2=80=99, =
=E2=80=98<samp>foo_sources</samp>=E2=80=99, and
=E2=80=98<samp>foo_print</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Note that <em>nested variable references</em> are quite different from
<em>recursively expanded variables</em>
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors"=
>The Two Flavors of Variables</a>), though both are
used together in complex ways when doing makefile programming.

<p>To set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the vari=
able
name followed by one of the assignment operators =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=
=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99,
=E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, or =E2=80=98<samp>:::=3D</samp>=E2=80=
=99.  Whatever follows the operator and any initial
whitespace on the line becomes the value.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
</pre></div>

<p>defines a variable named <code>objects</code> to contain the value =E2=
=80=98<samp>main.o
foo.o bar.o utils.o</samp>=E2=80=99.  Whitespace around the variable name a=
nd immediately
after the =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 is ignored.
</p>
<p>Variables defined with =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 are <em>recurs=
ively expanded</em> variables.
Variables defined with =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<sam=
p>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 are <em>simply expanded</em>
variables; these definitions can contain variable references which will be
expanded before the definition is made.  Variables defined with =E2=80=98<s=
amp>:::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99
are <em>immediately expanded</em> variables.  The different assignment oper=
ators
are described in See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ma=
ke.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>The variable name may contain function and variable references, which
are expanded when the line is read to find the actual variable name to use.
</p>
<p>There is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the
amount of memory on the computer.  You can split the value of a
variable into multiple physical lines for readability
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Splittin=
g-Lines">Splitting Long Lines</a>).
</p>
<p>Most variable names are considered to have the empty string as a value i=
f
you have never set them.  Several variables have built-in initial values
that are not empty, but you can set them in the usual ways
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit=
-Variables">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</a>).
Several special variables are set
automatically to a new value for each rule; these are called the
<em>automatic</em> variables (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/m=
ake/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>If you=E2=80=99d like a variable to be set to a value only if it=E2=80=
=99s not already
set, then you can use the shorthand operator =E2=80=98<samp>?=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 instead of
=E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99.  These two settings of the variable =E2=
=80=98<samp>FOO</samp>=E2=80=99 are identical
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-F=
unction">The <code>origin</code> Function</a>):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">FOO ?=3D bar
</pre></div>

<p>and
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
FOO =3D bar
endif
</pre></div>

<p>The shell assignment operator =E2=80=98<samp>!=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 can be=
 used to execute a
shell script and set a variable to its output.  This operator first
evaluates the right-hand side, then passes that result to the shell
for execution.  If the result of the execution ends in a newline, that
one newline is removed; all other newlines are replaced by spaces.
The resulting string is then placed into the named
recursively-expanded variable.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">hash !=3D printf '\043'
file_list !=3D find . -name '*.c'
</pre></div>

<p>If the result of the execution could produce a <code>$</code>, and you d=
on=E2=80=99t
intend what follows that to be interpreted as a make variable or
function reference, then you must replace every <code>$</code> with
<code>$$</code> as part of the execution.  Alternatively, you can set a
simply expanded variable to the result of running a program using the
<code>shell</code> function call.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softw=
are/make/manual/make.html#Shell-Function">The <code>shell</code>
Function</a>.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">hash :=3D $(shell printf '\043')
var :=3D $(shell find . -name "*.c")
</pre></div>

<p>As with the <code>shell</code> function, the exit status of the just-inv=
oked
shell script is stored in the <code>.SHELLSTATUS</code> variable.

<span id=3D"index-appending-to-variables"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-appending-to"></span>

<p>Often it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already d=
efined.
You do this with a line containing =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, lik=
e this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects +=3D another.o
</pre></div>

<p>This takes the value of the variable <code>objects</code>, and adds the =
text
=E2=80=98<samp>another.o</samp>=E2=80=99 to it (preceded by a single space,=
 if it has a value
already).  Thus:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
objects +=3D another.o
</pre></div>

<p>sets <code>objects</code> to =E2=80=98<samp>main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o a=
nother.o</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Using =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 is similar to:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
objects :=3D $(objects) another.o
</pre></div>

<p>but differs in ways that become important when you use more complex valu=
es.
</p>
<p>When the variable in question has not been defined before, =E2=80=98<sam=
p>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99
acts just like normal =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99: it defines a recu=
rsively-expanded
variable.  However, when there <em>is</em> a previous definition, exactly
what =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 does depends on what flavor of var=
iable you defined
originally.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</a>, for an
explanation of the two flavors of variables.
</p>
<p>When you add to a variable=E2=80=99s value with =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</sam=
p>=E2=80=99, <code>make</code> acts
essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial definition=
 of
the variable.  If you defined it first with =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, making it
a simply-expanded variable, =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 adds to tha=
t simply-expanded definition,
and expands the new text before appending it to the old value just as
=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 does (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.or=
g/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting">Setting Variables</a>, for a full=
 explanation
of =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=
=99).  In fact,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">variable :=3D value
variable +=3D more
</pre></div>

<p>is exactly equivalent to:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">variable :=3D value
variable :=3D $(variable) more
</pre></div>

<p>On the other hand, when you use =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 with=
 a variable that you defined
first to be recursively-expanded using plain =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>:::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99,
<code>make</code> appends the un-expanded text to the existing value, whate=
ver it
is.  This means that
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">variable =3D value
variable +=3D more
</pre></div>

<p>is roughly equivalent to:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">temp =3D value
variable =3D $(temp) more
</pre></div>

<p>except that of course it never defines a variable called <code>temp</cod=
e>.
The importance of this comes when the variable=E2=80=99s old value contains
variable references.  Take this common example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">CFLAGS =3D $(includes) -O
=E2=80=A6
CFLAGS +=3D -pg # enable profiling
</pre></div>

<p>The first line defines the <code>CFLAGS</code> variable with a reference=
 to another
variable, <code>includes</code>.  (<code>CFLAGS</code> is used by the rules=
 for C
compilation; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#Catalogue-of-Rules">Catalogue of Built-In Rules</a>.)
Using =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 for the definition makes <code>CFL=
AGS</code> a recursively-expanded
variable, meaning =E2=80=98<samp>$(includes)&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebrea=
k">-O</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> is <em>not</em> expanded when
<code>make</code> processes the definition of <code>CFLAGS</code>.  Thus, <=
code>includes</code>
need not be defined yet for its value to take effect.  It only has to be
defined before any reference to <code>CFLAGS</code>.  If we tried to append=
 to the
value of <code>CFLAGS</code> without using =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=
=99, we might do it like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">CFLAGS :=3D $(CFLAGS) -pg # enable profiling
</pre></div>

<p>This is pretty close, but not quite what we want.  Using =E2=80=98<samp>=
:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99
redefines <code>CFLAGS</code> as a simply-expanded variable; this means
<code>make</code> expands the text =E2=80=98<samp>$(CFLAGS)&nbsp;<span clas=
s=3D"nolinebreak">-pg</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> before setting the
variable.  If <code>includes</code> is not yet defined, we get =E2=80=98<sa=
mp>&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebreak">-O</span>&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebr=
eak">-pg</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->, and a later definition of <cod=
e>includes</code> will have no effect.
Conversely, by using =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 we set <code>CFLAG=
S</code> to the
<em>unexpanded</em> value =E2=80=98<samp>$(includes)&nbsp;<span class=3D"no=
linebreak">-O</span>&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebreak">-pg</span></samp>=E2=
=80=99<!-- /@w -->.  Thus we preserve
the reference to <code>includes</code>, so if that variable gets defined at
any later point, a reference like =E2=80=98<samp>$(CFLAGS)</samp>=E2=80=99 =
still uses its
value.

<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-overriding"></span>

<p>If a variable has been set with a command argument
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Overridi=
ng">Overriding Variables</a>),
then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored.  If you want to set
the variable in the makefile even though it was set with a command
argument, you can use an <code>override</code> directive, which is a line t=
hat
looks like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override <var>variable</var> =3D <var>value</var>
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override <var>variable</var> :=3D <var>value</var>
</pre></div>

<p>To append more text to a variable defined on the command line, use:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override <var>variable</var> +=3D <var>more text</va=
r>
</pre></div>

<p>See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Append=
ing">Appending More Text to Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>Variable assignments marked with the <code>override</code> flag have a
higher priority than all other assignments, except another
<code>override</code>.  Subsequent assignments or appends to this variable
which are not marked <code>override</code> will be ignored.
</p>
<p>The <code>override</code> directive was not invented for escalation in t=
he war
between makefiles and command arguments.  It was invented so you can alter
and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose you always want the =E2=80=98<samp>-g</samp>=E2=80=
=99 switch when you run the
C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other
switches with a command argument just as usual.  You could use this
<code>override</code> directive:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override CFLAGS +=3D -g
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use <code>override</code> directives with <code>define</cod=
e> directives.
This is done as you might expect:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override define foo =3D
bar
endef
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-defining-verbatim"></span>

<p>Another way to set the value of a variable is to use the <code>define</c=
ode>
directive.  This directive has an unusual syntax which allows newline
characters to be included in the value, which is convenient for
defining both canned sequences of commands (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.=
org/software/make/manual/make.html#Canned-Recipes">Defining Canned Recipes<=
/a>), and also sections of makefile syntax to
use with <code>eval</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=
e/manual/make.html#Eval-Function">The <code>eval</code> Function</a>).
</p>
<p>The <code>define</code> directive is followed on the same line by the na=
me
of the variable being defined and an (optional) assignment operator,
and nothing more.  The value to give the variable appears on the
following lines.  The end of the value is marked by a line containing
just the word <code>endef</code>.
</p>
<p>Aside from this difference in syntax, <code>define</code> works just lik=
e
any other variable definition.  The variable name may contain function
and variable references, which are expanded when the directive is read
to find the actual variable name to use.
</p>
<p>The final newline before the <code>endef</code> is not included in the
value; if you want your value to contain a trailing newline you must
include a blank line.  For example in order to define a variable that
contains a newline character you must use <em>two</em> empty lines, not one=
:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">define newline


endef
</pre></div>

<p>You may omit the variable assignment operator if you prefer.  If
omitted, <code>make</code> assumes it to be =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=
=99 and creates a
recursively-expanded variable (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/=
make/manual/make.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</a>).
When using a =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 operator, the value is app=
ended to the previous
value as with any other append operation: with a single space
separating the old and new values.
</p>
<p>You may nest <code>define</code> directives: <code>make</code> will keep=
 track of
nested directives and report an error if they are not all properly
closed with <code>endef</code>.  Note that lines beginning with the recipe
prefix character are considered part of a recipe, so any <code>define</code=
>
or <code>endef</code> strings appearing on such a line will not be
considered <code>make</code> directives.
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">define two-lines
echo foo
echo $(bar)
endef
</pre></div>

<p>When used in a recipe, the previous example is functionally equivalent
to this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">two-lines =3D echo foo; echo $(bar)
</pre></div>

<p>since two commands separated by semicolon behave much like two separate
shell commands.  However, note that using two separate lines means
<code>make</code> will invoke the shell twice, running an independent sub-s=
hell
for each line.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#Execution">Recipe Execution</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want variable definitions made with <code>define</code> to take
precedence over command-line variable definitions, you can use the
<code>override</code> directive together with <code>define</code>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override define two-lines =3D
foo
$(bar)
endef
</pre></div>

<p>If you want to clear a variable, setting its value to empty is usually
sufficient. Expanding such a variable will yield the same result (empty
string) regardless of whether it was set or not. However, if you are
using the <code>flavor</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/=
make/manual/make.html#Flavor-Function">The <code>flavor</code> Function</a>=
) and
<code>origin</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manua=
l/make.html#Origin-Function">The <code>origin</code> Function</a>) function=
s, there is a difference
between a variable that was never set and a variable with an empty value.
In such situations you may want to use the <code>undefine</code> directive =
to
make a variable appear as if it was never set. For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo :=3D foo
bar =3D bar

undefine foo
undefine bar

$(info $(origin foo))
$(info $(flavor bar))
</pre></div>

<p>This example will print =E2=80=9Cundefined=E2=80=9D for both variables.
</p>
<p>If you want to undefine a command-line variable definition, you can use
the <code>override</code> directive together with <code>undefine</code>, si=
milar to
how this is done for variable definitions:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override undefine CFLAGS

10 Variables from the Environment</h3>

<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-environment-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-environment"></span>
<p>Variables in <code>make</code> can come from the environment in which
<code>make</code> is run.  Every environment variable that <code>make</code=
> sees
when it starts up is transformed into a <code>make</code> variable with the
same name and value.  However, an explicit assignment in the makefile,
or with a command argument, overrides the environment.  (If the
=E2=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=99 flag is specified, then values from the e=
nvironment override
assignments in the makefile.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/m=
ake/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of
Options</a>.  But this is not recommended practice.)
</p>
<p>Thus, by setting the variable <code>CFLAGS</code> in your environment, y=
ou can
cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you
prefer.  This is safe for variables with standard or conventional meanings
because you know that no makefile will use them for other things.  (Note
this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set <code>CFLAGS</code> explic=
itly
and therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)
</p>
<p>When <code>make</code> runs a recipe, some variables defined in the make=
file
are placed into the environment of each command <code>make</code> invokes.
By default, only variables that came from the <code>make</code>=E2=80=99s
environment or set on its command line are placed into the environment
of the commands.  You can use the <code>export</code> directive to pass
other variables.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/m=
ake.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables
to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>, for full details.
</p>
<p>Other use of variables from the environment is not recommended.  It is n=
ot
wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on environment variables
set up outside their control, since this would cause different users to get
different results from the same makefile.  This is against the whole
purpose of most makefiles.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-SHELL_002c-import-from-environment"></span>
<p>Such problems would be especially likely with the variable
<code>SHELL</code>, which is normally present in the environment to specify
the user=E2=80=99s choice of interactive shell.  It would be very undesirab=
le
for this choice to affect <code>make</code>; so, <code>make</code> handles =
the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable in a special way; see <a href=3D"ht=
tps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Choosing-the-Shell">Choosi=

<span id=3D"index-target_002dspecific-variables"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-target_002dspecific"></span>

<p>Variable values in <code>make</code> are usually global; that is, they a=
re the
same regardless of where they are evaluated (unless they=E2=80=99re reset, =
of
course).  Exceptions to that are variables defined with the <code>let</code=
>
function (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=
#Let-Function">The <code>let</code> Function</a>) or the <code>foreach</cod=
e> function
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Foreach-=
Function">The <code>foreach</code> Function</a>, and automatic variables
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automati=
c-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>Another exception are <em>target-specific variable values</em>.  This
feature allows you to define different values for the same variable,
based on the target that <code>make</code> is currently building.  As with
automatic variables, these values are only available within the context
of a target=E2=80=99s recipe (and in other target-specific assignments).
</p>
<p>Set a target-specific variable value like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>target</var> =E2=80=A6 : <var>variable-assignme=
nt</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Target-specific variable assignments can be prefixed with any or all of =
the
special keywords <code>export</code>, <code>unexport</code>, <code>override=
</code>, or
<code>private</code>; these apply their normal behavior to this instance of=
 the
variable only.
</p>
<p>Multiple <var>target</var> values create a target-specific variable valu=
e for
each member of the target list individually.
</p>
<p>The <var>variable-assignment</var> can be any valid form of assignment; =
recursive
(=E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99), simple (=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99), immediate (=E2=80=98<samp>=
::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99),
appending (=E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99), or conditional (=E2=80=98<=
samp>?=3D</samp>=E2=80=99).  All variables that appear
within the <var>variable-assignment</var> are evaluated within the context =
of the
target: thus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values will b=
e
in effect.  Note that this variable is actually distinct from any =E2=80=9C=
global=E2=80=9D
value: the two variables do not have to have the same flavor (recursive vs.
simple).
</p>
<p>Target-specific variables have the same priority as any other makefile
variable.  Variables provided on the command line (and in the
environment if the =E2=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=99 option is in force) wi=
ll take precedence.
Specifying the <code>override</code> directive will allow the target-specif=
ic
variable value to be preferred.
</p>
<p>There is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when
you define a target-specific variable that variable value is also in
effect for all prerequisites of this target, and all their
prerequisites, etc. (unless those prerequisites override that variable
with their own target-specific variable value).  So, for example, a
statement like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">prog : CFLAGS =3D -g
prog : prog.o foo.o bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>will set <code>CFLAGS</code> to =E2=80=98<samp>-g</samp>=E2=80=99 in the=
 recipe for <samp>prog</samp>, but
it will also set <code>CFLAGS</code> to =E2=80=98<samp>-g</samp>=E2=80=99 i=
n the recipes that create
<samp>prog.o</samp>, <samp>foo.o</samp>, and <samp>bar.o</samp>, and any re=
cipes which
create their prerequisites.
</p>
<p>Be aware that a given prerequisite will only be built once per
invocation of make, at most.  If the same file is a prerequisite of
multiple targets, and each of those targets has a different value for
the same target-specific variable, then the first target to be built
will cause that prerequisite to be built and the prerequisite will
inherit the target-specific value from the first target.  It will
ignore the target-specific values from any other targets.

<span id=3D"index-pattern_002dspecific-variables"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-pattern_002dspecific"></span>

<p>In addition to target-specific variable values
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Target_0=
02dspecific">Target-specific Variable Values</a>), GNU
<code>make</code> supports pattern-specific variable values.  In this form,
the variable is defined for any target that matches the pattern
specified.
</p>
<p>Set a pattern-specific variable value like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>pattern</var> =E2=80=A6 : <var>variable-assignm=
ent</var>
</pre></div>
<p>where <var>pattern</var> is a %-pattern.  As with target-specific variab=
le
values, multiple <var>pattern</var> values create a pattern-specific variab=
le
value for each pattern individually.  The <var>variable-assignment</var> ca=
n
be any valid form of assignment.  Any command line variable setting will
take precedence, unless <code>override</code> is specified.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.o : CFLAGS =3D -O
</pre></div>

<p>will assign <code>CFLAGS</code> the value of =E2=80=98<samp>-O</samp>=E2=
=80=99 for all targets
matching the pattern <code>%.o</code>.
</p>
<p>If a target matches more than one pattern, the matching pattern-specific
variables with longer stems are interpreted first. This results in more
specific variables taking precedence over the more generic ones, for
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@

lib/%.o: CFLAGS :=3D -fPIC -g
%.o: CFLAGS :=3D -g

all: foo.o lib/bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>In this example the first definition of the <code>CFLAGS</code> variable
will be used to update <samp>lib/bar.o</samp> even though the second one
also applies to this target. Pattern-specific variables which result
in the same stem length are considered in the order in which they
were defined in the makefile.
</p>
<p>Pattern-specific variables are searched after any target-specific
variables defined explicitly for that target, and before target-specific
variables defined for the parent target.

<p>As described in previous sections, <code>make</code> variables are inher=
ited
by prerequisites.  This capability allows you to modify the behavior
of a prerequisite based on which targets caused it to be rebuilt.  For
example, you might set a target-specific variable on a <code>debug</code>
target, then running =E2=80=98<samp>make debug</samp>=E2=80=99 will cause t=
hat variable to be
inherited by all prerequisites of <code>debug</code>, while just running
=E2=80=98<samp>make all</samp>=E2=80=99 (for example) would not have that a=
ssignment.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you may not want a variable to be inherited.  For
these situations, <code>make</code> provides the <code>private</code> modif=
ier.
Although this modifier can be used with any variable assignment, it
makes the most sense with target- and pattern-specific variables.  Any
variable marked <code>private</code> will be visible to its local target bu=
t
will not be inherited by prerequisites of that target.  A global
variable marked <code>private</code> will be visible in the global scope bu=
t
will not be inherited by any target, and hence will not be visible
in any recipe.
</p>
<p>As an example, consider this makefile:
</p><div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">EXTRA_CFLAGS =3D

prog: private EXTRA_CFLAGS =3D -L/usr/local/lib
prog: a.o b.o
</pre></div>

<p>Due to the <code>private</code> modifier, <code>a.o</code> and <code>b.o=
</code> will not
inherit the <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS</code> variable assignment from the
<code>prog</code> target.

</dd>
<dt><span><code>.EXTRA_PREREQS</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Each word in this variable is a new prerequisite which is added to
targets for which it is set.  These prerequisites differ from normal
prerequisites in that they do not appear in any of the automatic
variables (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.htm=
l#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).  This allows prerequisites=
 to
be defined which do not impact the recipe.
</p>
<p>Consider a rule to link a program:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">myprog: myprog.o file1.o file2.o
       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
</pre></div>

<p>Now suppose you want to enhance this makefile to ensure that updates
to the compiler cause the program to be re-linked.  You can add the
compiler as a prerequisite, but you must ensure that it=E2=80=99s not passe=
d
as an argument to link command.  You=E2=80=99ll need something like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">myprog: myprog.o file1.o file2.o $(CC)
       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ \
           $(filter-out $(CC),$^) $(LDLIBS)
</pre></div>

<p>Then consider having multiple extra prerequisites: they would all have
to be filtered out.  Using <code>.EXTRA_PREREQS</code> and target-specific
variables provides a simpler solution:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">myprog: myprog.o file1.o file2.o
       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
myprog: .EXTRA_PREREQS =3D $(CC)
</pre></div>

<p>This feature can also be useful if you want to add prerequisites to a
makefile you cannot easily modify: you can create a new file such as
<samp>extra.mk</samp>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">myprog: .EXTRA_PREREQS =3D $(CC)
</pre></div>

<p>then invoke <code>make -f extra.mk -f Makefile</code>.
</p>
<p>Setting <code>.EXTRA_PREREQS</code> globally will cause those prerequisi=

<p>A <em>conditional</em> directive causes part of a makefile to be obeyed
or ignored depending on the values of variables.  Conditionals can
compare the value of one variable to another, or the value of a
variable to a constant string.  Conditionals control what <code>make</code>
actually =E2=80=9Csees=E2=80=9D in the makefile, so they <em>cannot</em> be=
 used to
control recipes at the time of execution.

<span id=3D"Example-of-a-Conditional"></span><h3 class=3D"section">7.1 Exam=
ple of a Conditional</h3>

<p>The following example of a conditional tells <code>make</code> to use on=
e
set of libraries if the <code>CC</code> variable is =E2=80=98<samp>gcc</sam=
p>=E2=80=99, and a
different set of libraries otherwise.  It works by controlling which
of two recipe lines will be used for the rule.  The result is that
=E2=80=98<samp>CC=3Dgcc</samp>=E2=80=99 as an argument to <code>make</code>=
 changes not only which
compiler is used but also which libraries are linked.
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">libs_for_gcc =3D -lgnu
normal_libs =3D

foo: $(objects)
ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
else
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
endif
</pre></div>

<p>This conditional uses three directives: one <code>ifeq</code>, one <code=
>else</code>
and one <code>endif</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>ifeq</code> directive begins the conditional, and specifies th=
e
condition.  It contains two arguments, separated by a comma and surrounded
by parentheses.  Variable substitution is performed on both arguments and
then they are compared.  The lines of the makefile following the
<code>ifeq</code> are obeyed if the two arguments match; otherwise they are
ignored.
</p>
<p>The <code>else</code> directive causes the following lines to be obeyed =
if the
previous conditional failed.  In the example above, this means that the
second alternative linking command is used whenever the first alternative
is not used.  It is optional to have an <code>else</code> in a conditional.
</p>
<p>The <code>endif</code> directive ends the conditional.  Every conditiona=
l must
end with an <code>endif</code>.  Unconditional makefile text follows.
</p>
<p>As this example illustrates, conditionals work at the textual level:
the lines of the conditional are treated as part of the makefile, or
ignored, according to the condition.  This is why the larger syntactic
units of the makefile, such as rules, may cross the beginning or the
end of the conditional.
</p>
<p>When the variable <code>CC</code> has the value =E2=80=98<samp>gcc</samp=
>=E2=80=99, the above example has
this effect:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
</pre></div>

<p>When the variable <code>CC</code> has any other value, the effect is thi=
s:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
</pre></div>

<p>Equivalent results can be obtained in another way by conditionalizing a
variable assignment and then using the variable unconditionally:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">libs_for_gcc =3D -lgnu
normal_libs =3D

ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
  libs=3D$(libs_for_gcc)
else
  libs=3D$(normal_libs)
endif

foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs)
</pre></div>

<p>The syntax of a simple conditional with no <code>else</code> is as follo=
ws:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>conditional-directive</var>
<var>text-if-true</var>
endif
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>text-if-true</var> may be any lines of text, to be considered a=
s part
of the makefile if the condition is true.  If the condition is false, no
text is used instead.
</p>
<p>The syntax of a complex conditional is as follows:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>conditional-directive</var>
<var>text-if-true</var>
else
<var>text-if-false</var>
endif
</pre></div>

<p>or:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>conditional-directive-one</var>
<var>text-if-one-is-true</var>
else <var>conditional-directive-two</var>
<var>text-if-two-is-true</var>
else
<var>text-if-one-and-two-are-false</var>
endif
</pre></div>

<p>There can be as many =E2=80=9C<code>else</code> <var>conditional-directi=
ve</var>=E2=80=9D
clauses as necessary.  Once a given condition is true,
<var>text-if-true</var> is used and no other clause is used; if no
condition is true then <var>text-if-false</var> is used.  The
<var>text-if-true</var> and <var>text-if-false</var> can be any number of l=
ines
of text.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the <var>conditional-directive</var> is the same whether t=
he
conditional is simple or complex; after an <code>else</code> or not.  There
are four different directives that test different conditions.  Here is
a table of them:
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt><span><code>ifeq (<var>arg1</var>, <var>arg2</var>)</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>ifeq '<var>arg1</var>' '<var>arg2</var>'</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>ifeq "<var>arg1</var>" "<var>arg2</var>"</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>ifeq "<var>arg1</var>" '<var>arg2</var>'</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>ifeq '<var>arg1</var>' "<var>arg2</var>"</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Expand all variable references in <var>arg1</var> and <var>arg2</var=
> and
compare them.  If they are identical, the <var>text-if-true</var> is
effective; otherwise, the <var>text-if-false</var>, if any, is effective.
</p>
<p>Often you want to test if a variable has a non-empty value.  When the
value results from complex expansions of variables and functions,
expansions you would consider empty may actually contain whitespace
characters and thus are not seen as empty.  However, you can use the
<code>strip</code> function (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/ma=
ke/manual/make.html#Text-Functions">Functions for String Substitution and A=
nalysis</a>) to avoid interpreting
whitespace as a non-empty value.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifeq ($(strip $(foo)),)
<var>text-if-empty</var>
endif
</pre></div>

<p>will evaluate <var>text-if-empty</var> even if the expansion of
<code>$(foo)</code> contains whitespace characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>ifneq (<var>arg1</var>, <var>arg2</var>)</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>ifneq '<var>arg1</var>' '<var>arg2</var>'</code></span></dt=
>
<dt><span><code>ifneq "<var>arg1</var>" "<var>arg2</var>"</code></span></dt=
>
<dt><span><code>ifneq "<var>arg1</var>" '<var>arg2</var>'</code></span></dt=
>
<dt><span><code>ifneq '<var>arg1</var>' "<var>arg2</var>"</code></span></dt=
>
<dd><p>Expand all variable references in <var>arg1</var> and <var>arg2</var=
> and
compare them.  If they are different, the <var>text-if-true</var> is
effective; otherwise, the <var>text-if-false</var>, if any, is effective.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>ifdef <var>variable-name</var></code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>ifdef</code> form takes the <em>name</em> of a variable as=
 its
argument, not a reference to a variable.  If the value of that
variable has a non-empty value, the <var>text-if-true</var> is effective;
otherwise, the <var>text-if-false</var>, if any, is effective.  Variables
that have never been defined have an empty value.  The text
<var>variable-name</var> is expanded, so it could be a variable or function
that expands to the name of a variable.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">bar =3D true
foo =3D bar
ifdef $(foo)
frobozz =3D yes
endif
</pre></div>

<p>The variable reference <code>$(foo)</code> is expanded, yielding <code>b=
ar</code>,
which is considered to be the name of a variable.  The variable
<code>bar</code> is not expanded, but its value is examined to determine if
it is non-empty.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>ifdef</code> only tests whether a variable has a value. =
 It
does not expand the variable to see if that value is nonempty.
Consequently, tests using <code>ifdef</code> return true for all definition=
s
except those like <code>foo =3D</code>.  To test for an empty value, use
<code>ifeq&nbsp;($(foo),)</code><!-- /@w -->.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">bar =3D
foo =3D $(bar)
ifdef foo
frobozz =3D yes
else
frobozz =3D no
endif
</pre></div>

<p>sets =E2=80=98<samp>frobozz</samp>=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98<samp>yes</samp>=
=E2=80=99, while:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo =3D
ifdef foo
frobozz =3D yes
else
frobozz =3D no
endif
</pre></div>

<p>sets =E2=80=98<samp>frobozz</samp>=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98<samp>no</samp>=
=E2=80=99.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>ifndef <var>variable-name</var></code></span></dt>
<dd><p>If the variable <var>variable-name</var> has an empty value, the
<var>text-if-true</var> is effective; otherwise, the <var>text-if-false</va=
r>,
if any, is effective.  The rules for expansion and testing of
<var>variable-name</var> are identical to the <code>ifdef</code> directive.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the
conditional directive line, but a tab is not allowed.  (If the line
begins with a tab, it will be considered part of a recipe for a rule.)
Aside from this, extra spaces or tabs may be inserted with no effect
anywhere except within the directive name or within an argument.  A
comment starting with =E2=80=98<samp>#</samp>=E2=80=99 may appear at the en=
d of the line.
</p>
<p>The other two directives that play a part in a conditional are <code>els=
e</code>
and <code>endif</code>.  Each of these directives is written as one word, w=
ith no
arguments.  Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the
line, and spaces or tabs at the end.  A comment starting with =E2=80=98<sam=
p>#</samp>=E2=80=99 may
appear at the end of the line.
</p>
<p>Conditionals affect which lines of the makefile <code>make</code> uses. =
 If
the condition is true, <code>make</code> reads the lines of the
<var>text-if-true</var> as part of the makefile; if the condition is false,
<code>make</code> ignores those lines completely.  It follows that syntacti=
c
units of the makefile, such as rules, may safely be split across the
beginning or the end of the conditional.
</p>
<p><code>make</code> evaluates conditionals when it reads a makefile.
Consequently, you cannot use automatic variables in the tests of
conditionals because they are not defined until recipes are run
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automati=
c-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>To prevent intolerable confusion, it is not permitted to start a
conditional in one makefile and end it in another.  However, you may
write an <code>include</code> directive within a conditional, provided you =
do
not attempt to terminate the conditional inside the included file.

<span id=3D"Conditionals-that-Test-Flags"></span><h3 class=3D"section">7.3 =
Conditionals that Test Flags</h3>

<p>You can write a conditional that tests <code>make</code> command flags s=
uch as
=E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 by using the variable <code>MAKEFLAGS</co=
de> together with the
<code>findstring</code> function
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Fun=
ctions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</a>).
This is useful when <code>touch</code> is not enough to make a file appear =
up
to date.
</p>
<p>Recall that <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> will put all single-letter options (s=
uch as
=E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99) into the first word, and that word will =
be empty if no
single-letter options were given.  To work with this, it=E2=80=99s helpful =
to add a
value at the start to ensure there=E2=80=99s a word: for example
=E2=80=98<samp>-$(MAKEFLAGS)</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>The <code>findstring</code> function determines whether one string appea=
rs as a
substring of another.  If you want to test for the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=
=E2=80=99 flag, use
=E2=80=98<samp>t</samp>=E2=80=99 as the first string and the first word of =
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> as the
other.
</p>
<p>For example, here is how to arrange to use =E2=80=98<samp>ranlib -t</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 to finish
marking an archive file up to date:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">archive.a: =E2=80=A6
ifneq (,$(findstring t,$(firstword -$(MAKEFLAGS))))
        +touch archive.a
        +ranlib -t archive.a
else
        ranlib archive.a
endif
</pre></div>

<p>The =E2=80=98<samp>+</samp>=E2=80=99 prefix marks those recipe lines as =
=E2=80=9Crecursive=E2=80=9D so that
they will be executed despite use of the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 =
flag.

 Call Syntax</h3>

<p>A function call resembles a variable reference.  It can appear
anywhere a variable reference can appear, and it is expanded using the
same rules as variable references.  A function call looks like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(<var>function</var> <var>arguments</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>or like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">${<var>function</var> <var>arguments</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Here <var>function</var> is a function name; one of a short list of name=
s
that are part of <code>make</code>.  You can also essentially create your o=
wn
functions by using the <code>call</code> built-in function.
</p>
<p>The <var>arguments</var> are the arguments of the function.  They are se=
parated
from the function name by one or more spaces or tabs, and if there is more
than one argument, then they are separated by commas.  Such whitespace and
commas are not part of an argument=E2=80=99s value.  The delimiters which y=
ou use to
surround the function call, whether parentheses or braces, can appear in an
argument only in matching pairs; the other kind of delimiters may appear
singly.  If the arguments themselves contain other function calls or variab=
le
references, it is wisest to use the same kind of delimiters for all the
references; write =E2=80=98<samp>$(subst&nbsp;a,b,$(x))</samp>=E2=80=99<!--=
 /@w -->, not =E2=80=98<samp>$(subst&nbsp;a,b,${x})</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w=
 -->.  This is because it is clearer, and because only one type of
delimiter is matched to find the end of the reference.
</p>
<p>Each argument is expanded before the function is invoked, unless otherwi=
se
noted below.  The substitution is done in the order in which the arguments
appear.
</p>
<span id=3D"Special-Characters"></span><h4 class=3D"subsubheading">Special =
Characters</h4>
<span id=3D"index-special-characters-in-function-arguments"></span>
<span id=3D"index-function-arguments_002c-special-characters-in"></span>

<p>When using characters that are special to <code>make</code> as function =
arguments,
you may need to hide them.  GNU <code>make</code> doesn=E2=80=99t support e=
scaping
characters with backslashes or other escape sequences; however, because
arguments are split before they are expanded you can hide them by putting t=
hem
into variables.
</p>
<p>Characters you may need to hide include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Commas
</li><li> Initial whitespace in the first argument
</li><li> Unmatched open parenthesis or brace
</li><li> An open parenthesis or brace if you don=E2=80=99t want it to star=
t a matched pair
</li></ul>

<p>For example, you can define variables <code>comma</code> and <code>space=
</code> whose
values are isolated comma and space characters, then substitute these
variables where such characters are wanted, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">comma:=3D ,
empty:=3D
space:=3D $(empty) $(empty)
foo:=3D a b c
bar:=3D $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))
# <span class=3D"roman">bar is now =E2=80=98a,b,c=E2=80=99.</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here the <code>subst</code> function replaces each space with a comma, t=
hrough
the value of <code>foo</code>, and substitutes the result.

<span id=3D"index-functions_002c-for-text"></span>

<p>Here are some functions that operate on strings:
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt id=3D"index-subst-1"><span><code>$(subst <var>from</var>,<var>to</var>,=
<var>text</var>)</code><a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/=

<dd><p>Performs a textual replacement on the text <var>text</var>: each occ=
urrence

 for
the function call.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(subst ee,EE,feet on the street)
</pre></div>

<p>produces the value =E2=80=98<samp>fEEt on the strEEt</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id=3D"index-patsubst-1"><span><code>$(patsubst <var>pattern</var>,<var>=
replacement</var>,<var>text</var>)</code><a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/sof=

<dd><p>Finds whitespace-separated words in <var>text</var> that match
<var>pattern</var> and replaces them with <var>replacement</var>.  Here
<var>pattern</var> may contain a =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 which act=
s as a wildcard,
matching any number of any characters within a word.  If
<var>replacement</var> also contains a =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99, th=
e =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 is replaced
by the text that matched the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in <var>patte=
rn</var>.  Words that do
not match the pattern are kept without change in the output.  Only the
first =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in the <var>pattern</var> and <var>r=
eplacement</var> is treated
this way; any subsequent =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 is unchanged.

<span id=3D"index-quoting-_0025_002c-in-patsubst"></span>
<p>=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters in <code>patsubst</code> fun=
ction invocations can be
quoted with preceding backslashes (=E2=80=98<samp>\</samp>=E2=80=99).  Back=
slashes that would
otherwise quote =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters can be quoted w=
ith more backslashes.
Backslashes that quote =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters or other=
 backslashes are
removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a stem
substituted into it.  Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 characters go unmolested.  For example, th=
e pattern
<samp>the\%weird\\%pattern\\</samp> has =E2=80=98<samp>the%weird\</samp>=E2=
=80=99 preceding the
operative =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 character, and =E2=80=98<samp>pa=
ttern\\</samp>=E2=80=99 following it.  The
final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 character.
</p>
<p>Whitespace between words is folded into single space characters;
leading and trailing whitespace is discarded.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)
</pre></div>

<p>produces the value =E2=80=98<samp>x.c.o bar.o</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Substitution references (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=
e/manual/make.html#Substitution-Refs">Substitution
References</a>) are a simpler way to get the effect of the <code>patsubst</=
code>
function:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(<var>var</var>:<var>pattern</var>=3D<var>replaceme=
nt</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(patsubst <var>pattern</var>,<var>replacement</var>=
,$(<var>var</var>))
</pre></div>

<p>The second shorthand simplifies one of the most common uses of
<code>patsubst</code>: replacing the suffix at the end of file names.
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(<var>var</var>:<var>suffix</var>=3D<var>replacemen=
t</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(patsubst %<var>suffix</var>,%<var>replacement</var=
>,$(<var>var</var>))
</pre></div>

<p>For example, you might have a list of object files:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">objects =3D foo.o bar.o baz.o
</pre></div>

<p>To get the list of corresponding source files, you could simply write:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(objects:.o=3D.c)
</pre></div>

<p>instead of using the general form:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(objects))
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt id=3D"index-stripping-whitespace"><span><code>$(strip <var>string</var>=

<dd><span id=3D"index-whitespace_002c-stripping"></span>
<span id=3D"index-spaces_002c-stripping"></span>
<span id=3D"index-strip"></span>
<p>Removes leading and trailing whitespace from <var>string</var> and repla=
ces
each internal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a
single space.  Thus, =E2=80=98<samp>$(strip a b  c )</samp>=E2=80=99 result=
s in =E2=80=98<samp>a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->.
</p>
<p>The function <code>strip</code> can be very useful when used in conjunct=
ion
with conditionals.  When comparing something with the empty string
=E2=80=98<samp></samp>=E2=80=99 using <code>ifeq</code> or <code>ifneq</cod=
e>, you usually want a string of
just whitespace to match the empty string (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.o=
rg/software/make/manual/make.html#Conditionals">Conditional Parts of Makefi=
les</a>).
</p>
<p>Thus, the following may fail to have the desired results:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.PHONY: all
ifneq   "$(needs_made)" ""
all: $(needs_made)
else
all:;@echo 'Nothing to make!'
endif
</pre></div>

<p>Replacing the variable reference =E2=80=98<samp><span class=3D"nolinebre=
ak">$(needs_made)</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> with the
function call =E2=80=98<samp>$(strip&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebreak">$(nee=
ds_made))</span></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> in the <code>ifneq</code>
directive would make it more robust.

function in a conditional to test for the presence of a specific
substring in a given string.  Thus, the two examples,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(findstring a,a b c)
$(findstring a,b c)
</pre></div>

<p>produce the values =E2=80=98<samp>a</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp><=
/samp>=E2=80=99 (the empty string),
respectively.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make=

ication of
<code>findstring</code>.

used in the <code>patsubst</code> function above.
</p>
<p>The <code>filter</code> function can be used to separate out different t=

</p>
<div class=3D"example">

<samp>baz.s</samp> and <samp>ugh.h</samp> but only <samp>foo.c</samp>, <sam=

function.

<p>For example, given:

</dl>


<p>Here is a realistic example of the use of <code>subst</code> and
<code>patsubst</code>.  Suppose that a makefile uses the <code>VPATH</code>=
 variable
to specify a list of directories that <code>make</code> should search for
prerequisite files
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#General-=
Search"><code>VPATH</code> Search Path for All Prerequisites</a>).
This example shows how to
tell the C compiler to search for header files in the same list of
directories.
</p>
<p>The value of <code>VPATH</code> is a list of directories separated by co=
lons,
such as =E2=80=98<samp>src:../headers</samp>=E2=80=99.  First, the <code>su=
bst</code> function is used to
change the colons to spaces:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">

<p>This produces =E2=80=98<samp>src ../headers</samp>=E2=80=99.  Then <code=
>patsubst</code> is used to turn
each directory name into a =E2=80=98<samp>-I</samp>=E2=80=99 flag.  These c=
an be added to the
value of the variable <code>CFLAGS</code>, which is passed automatically to=
 the C
compiler, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">override CFLAGS +=3D $(patsubst %,-I%,$(subst :, ,$(=

<p>The effect is to append the text =E2=80=98<samp>-Isrc -I../headers</samp=
>=E2=80=99 to the
previously given value of <code>CFLAGS</code>.  The <code>override</code> d=
irective is
used so that the new value is assigned even if the previous value of
<code>CFLAGS</code> was specified with a command argument (see <a href=3D"h=
ttps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Override-Directive">The <=

<span id=3D"index-functions_002c-for-file-names"></span>
<span id=3D"index-file-name-functions"></span>

<p>Several of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to
taking apart file names or lists of file names.
</p>
<p>Each of the following functions performs a specific transformation on a
file name.  The argument of the function is regarded as a series of file
names, separated by whitespace.  (Leading and trailing whitespace is
ignored.)  Each file name in the series is transformed in the same way and
the results are concatenated with single spaces between them.
</p>

<span id=3D"index-file-name_002c-directory-part"></span>
<p>Extracts the directory-part of each file name in <var>names</var>.  The
directory-part of the file name is everything up through (and
including) the last slash in it.  If the file name contains no slash,
the directory part is the string =E2=80=98<samp>./</samp>=E2=80=99.  For ex=
ample,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(dir src/foo.c hacks)
</pre></div>

<p>produces the result =E2=80=98<samp>src/ ./</samp>=E2=80=99.

<span id=3D"index-nondirectory-part"></span>
<p>Extracts all but the directory-part of each file name in <var>names</var=
>.
If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged.  Otherwise,
everything through the last slash is removed from it.
</p>
<p>A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string.  This is
unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always have the
same number of whitespace-separated file names as the argument had;
but we do not see any other valid alternative.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(notdir src/foo.c hacks)
</pre></div>

<var>names</var> contains multiple file names, the result may contain fewer
file names.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(suffix src/foo.c src-1.0/bar.c hacks)
</pre></div>

ignored.  If there is no period, the basename is the entire file name.
For example,

will be expanded.

</p>
<p>The first argument, <var>condition</var>, first has all preceding and
trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded.  If it expands to any
non-empty string, then the condition is considered to be true.  If it
expands to an empty string, the condition is considered to be false.
</p>
<p>If the condition is true then the second argument, <var>then-part</var>,=

 is
evaluated and this is the result of the <code>if</code> function.  If there=

empty string).
</p>
<p>Note that only one of the <var>then-part</var> or the <var>else-part</va=

<p>The left-hand side, <var>lhs</var>, and right-hand side, <var>rhs</var>,=

t</code> Function</h3>
<span id=3D"index-let"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-local"></span>

<p>The <code>let</code> function provides a means to limit the scope of a
variable.  The assignment of the named variables in a <code>let</code>
expression is in effect only within the text provided by the
<code>let</code> expression, and this assignment doesn=E2=80=99t impact tha=
t named
variable in any outer scope.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>let</code> function enables list unpacking by
assigning all unassigned values to the last named variable.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>let</code> function is:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(let <var>var</var> [<var>var</var> ...],[<var>list=
</var>],<var>text</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>The first two arguments, <var>var</var> and <var>list</var>, are expande=
d before
anything else is done; note that the last argument, <var>text</var>, is
<strong>not</strong> expanded at the same time.  Next, each word of the
expanded value of <var>list</var> is bound to each of the variable names,
<var>var</var>, in turn, with the final variable name being bound to the
remainder of the expanded <var>list</var>.  In other words, the first word
of <var>list</var> is bound to the first variable <var>var</var>, the secon=
d
word to the second variable <var>var</var>, and so on.
</p>
<p>If there are more variable names in <var>var</var> than there are words =
in
<var>list</var>, the remaining <var>var</var> variable names are set to the
empty string.  If there are fewer <var>var</var>s than words in <var>list</=
var>
then the last <var>var</var> is set to all remaining words in <var>list</va=
r>.
</p>
<p>The variables in <var>var</var> are assigned as simply-expanded variable=
s
during the execution of <code>let</code>.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.o=
rg/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors
of Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>After all variables are thus bound, <var>text</var> is expanded to provi=
de
the result of the <code>let</code> function.
</p>
<p>For example, this macro reverses the order of the words in the list
that it is given as its first argument:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">reverse =3D $(let first rest,$1,\
            $(if $(rest),$(call reverse,$(rest)) )$(first))

all: ; @echo $(call reverse,d c b a)
</pre></div>

<p>will print <code>a b c d</code>.  When first called, <code>let</code> wi=
ll expand
<var>$1</var> to <code>d c b a</code>.  It will then assign <var>first</var=
> to
<code>d</code> and assign <var>rest</var> to <code>c b a</code>.  It will t=
hen expand
the if-statement, where <code>$(rest)</code> is not empty so we recursively
invoke the <var>reverse</var> function with the value of <var>rest</var> wh=
ich
is now <code>c b a</code>.  The recursive invocation of <code>let</code> as=
signs
<var>first</var> to <code>c</code> and <var>rest</var> to <code>b a</code>.=
  The recursion
continues until <code>let</code> is called with just a single value,
<code>a</code>.  Here <var>first</var> is <code>a</code> and <var>rest</var=
> is empty, so we
do not recurse but simply expand <code>$(first)</code> to <code>a</code> an=
d
return, which adds <code> b</code>, etc.
</p>
<p>After the <var>reverse</var> call is complete, the <var>first</var> and
<var>rest</var> variables are no longer set.  If variables by those names
existed beforehand, they are not affected by the expansion of the
<code>reverse</code> macro.

<span id=3D"The-foreach-Function"></span><h3 class=3D"section">8.6 The <cod=
e>foreach</code> Function</h3>
<span id=3D"index-foreach"></span>
<span id=3D"index-words_002c-iterating-over"></span>

<p>The <code>foreach</code> function is similar to the <code>let</code> fun=
ction, but very
different from other functions.  It causes one piece of text to be used
repeatedly, each time with a different substitution performed on it.  The
<code>foreach</code> function resembles the <code>for</code> command in the
shell <code>sh</code> and the <code>foreach</code> command in the C-shell <=
code>csh</code>.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>foreach</code> function is:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(foreach <var>var</var>,<var>list</var>,<var>text</=
var>)
</pre></div>

<p>The first two arguments, <var>var</var> and <var>list</var>, are expande=
d before
anything else is done; note that the last argument, <var>text</var>, is
<strong>not</strong> expanded at the same time.  Then for each word of the =
expanded
value of <var>list</var>, the variable named by the expanded value of <var>=
var</var>
is set to that word, and <var>text</var> is expanded.  Presumably <var>text=
</var>
contains references to that variable, so its expansion will be different
each time.
</p>
<p>The result is that <var>text</var> is expanded as many times as there ar=
e
whitespace-separated words in <var>list</var>.  The multiple expansions of
<var>text</var> are concatenated, with spaces between them, to make the res=
ult
of <code>foreach</code>.
</p>
<p>This simple example sets the variable =E2=80=98<samp>files</samp>=E2=80=
=99 to the list of all files
in the directories in the list =E2=80=98<samp>dirs</samp>=E2=80=99:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">dirs :=3D a b c d
files :=3D $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(wildcard $(dir)/*))
</pre></div>

<p>Here <var>text</var> is =E2=80=98<samp>$(wildcard $(dir)/*)</samp>=E2=80=
=99.  The first repetition
finds the value =E2=80=98<samp>a</samp>=E2=80=99 for <code>dir</code>, so i=
t produces the same result
as =E2=80=98<samp>$(wildcard a/*)</samp>=E2=80=99; the second repetition pr=
oduces the result
of =E2=80=98<samp>$(wildcard b/*)</samp>=E2=80=99; and the third, that of =
=E2=80=98<samp>$(wildcard c/*)</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>This example has the same result (except for setting =E2=80=98<samp>dirs=
</samp>=E2=80=99) as
the following example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">files :=3D $(wildcard a/* b/* c/* d/*)
</pre></div>

<p>When <var>text</var> is complicated, you can improve readability by givi=
ng it
a name, with an additional variable:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">find_files =3D $(wildcard $(dir)/*)
dirs :=3D a b c d
files :=3D $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(find_files))
</pre></div>

<p>Here we use the variable <code>find_files</code> this way.  We use plain=
 =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99
to define a recursively-expanding variable, so that its value contains an
actual function call to be re-expanded under the control of <code>foreach</=
code>;
a simply-expanded variable would not do, since <code>wildcard</code> would =
be
called only once at the time of defining <code>find_files</code>.
</p>
<p>Like the <code>let</code> function, the <code>foreach</code> function ha=
s no permanent
effect on the variable <var>var</var>; its value and flavor after the
<code>foreach</code> function call are the same as they were beforehand.  T=
he
other values which are taken from <var>list</var> are in effect only
temporarily, during the execution of <code>foreach</code>.  The variable
<var>var</var> is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of
<code>foreach</code>.  If <var>var</var> was undefined before the <code>for=
each</code>
function call, it is undefined after the call.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">=
The Two Flavors of Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>You must take care when using complex variable expressions that result i=
n
variable names because many strange things are valid variable names, but
are probably not what you intended.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">files :=3D $(foreach Esta-escrito-en-espanol!,b c ch=
,$(find_files))
</pre></div>

<p>might be useful if the value of <code>find_files</code> references the v=
ariable
whose name is =E2=80=98<samp>Esta-escrito-en-espanol!</samp>=E2=80=99 (es u=
n nombre bastante largo,
no?), but it is more likely to be a mistake.

<p>The <code>file</code> function allows the makefile to write to or read f=
rom
a file.  Two modes of writing are supported: overwrite, where the text
is written to the beginning of the file and any existing content is
lost, and append, where the text is written to the end of the file,
preserving the existing content.  In both cases the file is created if
it does not exist.  It is a fatal error if the file cannot be opened
for writing, or if the write operation fails.  The <code>file</code>
function expands to the empty string when writing to a file.
</p>
<p>When reading from a file, the <code>file</code> function expands to the
verbatim contents of the file, except that the final newline (if there
is one) will be stripped.  Attempting to read from a non-existent file
expands to the empty string.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>file</code> function is:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(file <var>op</var> <var>filename</var>[,<var>text<=
/var>])
</pre></div>

<p>When the <code>file</code> function is evaluated all its arguments are
expanded first, then the file indicated by <var>filename</var> will be
opened in the mode described by <var>op</var>.
</p>
<p>The operator <var>op</var> can be <code>&gt;</code> to indicate the file=
 will be
overwritten with new content, <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to indicate the current
contents of the file will be appended to, or <code>&lt;</code> to indicate =
the
contents of the file will be read in.  The <var>filename</var> specifies
the file to be written to or read from.  There may optionally be
whitespace between the operator and the file name.
</p>
<p>When reading files, it is an error to provide a <var>text</var> value.
</p>
<p>When writing files, <var>text</var> will be written to the file.  If
<var>text</var> does not already end in a newline a final newline will be
written (even if <var>text</var> is the empty string).  If the <var>text</v=
ar>
argument is not given at all, nothing will be written.
</p>
<p>For example, the <code>file</code> function can be useful if your build
system has a limited command line size and your recipe runs a command
that can accept arguments from a file as well.  Many commands use the
convention that an argument prefixed with an <code>@</code> specifies a
file containing more arguments.  Then you might write your recipe in
this way:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">program: $(OBJECTS)
        $(file &gt;$@.in,$^)
        $(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in
        @rm $@.in
</pre></div>

<p>If the command required each argument to be on a separate line of the
input file, you might write your recipe like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">program: $(OBJECTS)
        $(file &gt;$@.in) $(foreach O,$^,$(file &gt;&gt;$@.in,$O))
        $(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in
        @rm $@.in
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-call"></span>
<span id=3D"index-functions_002c-user-defined"></span>
<span id=3D"index-user-defined-functions"></span>

<p>The <code>call</code> function is unique in that it can be used to creat=
e new
parameterized functions.  You can write a complex expression as the
value of a variable, then use <code>call</code> to expand it with different
values.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>call</code> function is:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(call <var>variable</var>,<var>param</var>,<var>par=
am</var>,=E2=80=A6)
</pre></div>

<p>When <code>make</code> expands this function, it assigns each <var>param=
</var> to
temporary variables <code>$(1)</code>, <code>$(2)</code>, etc.  The variabl=
e
<code>$(0)</code> will contain <var>variable</var>.  There is no maximum nu=
mber of
parameter arguments.  There is no minimum, either, but it doesn=E2=80=99t m=
ake
sense to use <code>call</code> with no parameters.
</p>
<p>Then <var>variable</var> is expanded as a <code>make</code> variable in =
the context
of these temporary assignments.  Thus, any reference to <code>$(1)</code> i=
n
the value of <var>variable</var> will resolve to the first <var>param</var>=
 in the
invocation of <code>call</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that <var>variable</var> is the <em>name</em> of a variable, not a
<em>reference</em> to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally use
a =E2=80=98<samp>$</samp>=E2=80=99 or parentheses when writing it.  (You ca=
n, however, use a
variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a
constant.)
</p>
<p>If <var>variable</var> is the name of a built-in function, the built-in =
function
is always invoked (even if a <code>make</code> variable by that name also
exists).
</p>
<p>The <code>call</code> function expands the <var>param</var> arguments be=
fore
assigning them to temporary variables.  This means that <var>variable</var>
values containing references to built-in functions that have special
expansion rules, like <code>foreach</code> or <code>if</code>, may not work=
 as you
expect.
</p>
<p>Some examples may make this clearer.
</p>
<p>This macro simply reverses its arguments:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">reverse =3D $(2) $(1)

foo =3D $(call reverse,a,b)
</pre></div>

<p>Here <code>foo</code> will contain =E2=80=98<samp>b a</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>This one is slightly more interesting: it defines a macro to search for
the first instance of a program in <code>PATH</code>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">pathsearch =3D $(firstword $(wildcard $(addsuffix /$=
(1),$(subst :, ,$(PATH)))))

LS :=3D $(call pathsearch,ls)
</pre></div>

<p>Now the variable <code>LS</code> contains <code>/bin/ls</code> or simila=
r.
</p>
<p>The <code>call</code> function can be nested.  Each recursive invocation=
 gets
its own local values for <code>$(1)</code>, etc. that mask the values of
higher-level <code>call</code>.  For example, here is an implementation of =
a
<em>map</em> function:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">map =3D $(foreach a,$(2),$(call $(1),$(a)))
</pre></div>

<p>Now you can <code>map</code> a function that normally takes only one arg=
ument,
such as <code>origin</code>, to multiple values in one step:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">o =3D $(call map,origin,o map MAKE)
</pre></div>

<p>and end up with <code>o</code> containing something like =E2=80=98<samp>=
file file default</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>A final caution: be careful when adding whitespace to the arguments to
<code>call</code>.  As with other functions, any whitespace contained in th=
e
second and subsequent arguments is kept; this can cause strange
effects.  It=E2=80=99s generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace=
 when
providing parameters to <code>call</code>.

value</code> Function</h3>
<span id=3D"index-value-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-unexpanded-value"></span>

<p>The <code>value</code> function provides a way for you to use the value =
of a
variable <em>without</em> having it expanded.  Please note that this
does not undo expansions which have already occurred; for example if
you create a simply expanded variable its value is expanded during the
definition; in that case the <code>value</code> function will return the
same result as using the variable directly.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>value</code> function is:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(value <var>variable</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>Note that <var>variable</var> is the <em>name</em> of a variable, not a
<em>reference</em> to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally
use a =E2=80=98<samp>$</samp>=E2=80=99 or parentheses when writing it.  (Yo=
u can, however, use
a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a
constant.)
</p>
<p>The result of this function is a string containing the value of
<var>variable</var>, without any expansion occurring.  For example, in this
makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">FOO =3D $PATH

all:
        @echo $(FOO)
        @echo $(value FOO)
</pre></div>

<p>The first output line would be <code>ATH</code>, since the =E2=80=9C$P=
=E2=80=9D would be
expanded as a <code>make</code> variable, while the second output line woul=
d
be the current value of your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable, since
the <code>value</code> function avoided the expansion.
</p>
<p>The <code>value</code> function is most often used in conjunction with t=
he
<code>eval</code> function (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=
e/manual/make.html#Eval-Function">The <code>eval</code> Function</a>).

<span id=3D"index-evaluating-makefile-syntax"></span>
<span id=3D"index-makefile-syntax_002c-evaluating"></span>

<p>The <code>eval</code> function is very special: it allows you to define =
new
makefile constructs that are not constant; which are the result of
evaluating other variables and functions.  The argument to the
<code>eval</code> function is expanded, then the results of that expansion
are parsed as makefile syntax.  The expanded results can define new
<code>make</code> variables, targets, implicit or explicit rules, etc.
</p>
<p>The result of the <code>eval</code> function is always the empty string;
thus, it can be placed virtually anywhere in a makefile without
causing syntax errors.
</p>
<p>It=E2=80=99s important to realize that the <code>eval</code> argument is=
 expanded
<em>twice</em>; first by the <code>eval</code> function, then the results o=
f
that expansion are expanded again when they are parsed as makefile
syntax.  This means you may need to provide extra levels of escaping
for =E2=80=9C$=E2=80=9D characters when using <code>eval</code>.  The <code=
>value</code>
function (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=
#Value-Function">The <code>value</code> Function</a>) can sometimes be usef=
ul in these
situations, to circumvent unwanted expansions.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of how <code>eval</code> can be used; this example
combines a number of concepts and other functions.  Although it might
seem overly complex to use <code>eval</code> in this example, rather than
just writing out the rules, consider two things: first, the template
definition (in <code>PROGRAM_template</code>) could need to be much more
complex than it is here; and second, you might put the complex,
=E2=80=9Cgeneric=E2=80=9D part of this example into another makefile, then =
include
it in all the individual makefiles.  Now your individual makefiles are
quite straightforward.

<p>This information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to
determine if you want to believe the value of a variable.  For example,
suppose you have a makefile <samp>foo</samp> that includes another makefile
<samp>bar</samp>.  You want a variable <code>bletch</code> to be defined in=
 <samp>bar</samp>
if you run the command =E2=80=98<samp>make&nbsp;<span class=3D"nolinebreak"=
>-f</span>&nbsp;bar</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->, even if the environment co=
ntains
a definition of <code>bletch</code>.  However, if <samp>foo</samp> defined
<code>bletch</code> before including <samp>bar</samp>, you do not want to o=
verride that
definition.  This could be done by using an <code>override</code> directive=
 in
<samp>foo</samp>, giving that definition precedence over the later definiti=
on in
<samp>bar</samp>; unfortunately, the <code>override</code> directive would =
also
override any command line definitions.  So, <samp>bar</samp> could
include:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifdef bletch
ifeq "$(origin bletch)" "environment"
bletch =3D barf, gag, etc.
endif
endif
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>bletch</code> has been defined from the environment, this will =
redefine
it.
</p>
<p>If you want to override a previous definition of <code>bletch</code> if =
it came
from the environment, even under =E2=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=99, you cou=
ld instead write:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifneq "$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))" "=
"
bletch =3D barf, gag, etc.
endif
</pre></div>

<p>Here the redefinition takes place if =E2=80=98<samp>$(origin bletch)</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 returns either
=E2=80=98<samp>environment</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>environment ov=
erride</samp>=E2=80=99.

if some sort of environmental error is detected.
</p>

<p>Generates a fatal error where the message is <var>text</var>.  Note that
the error is generated whenever this function is evaluated.  So, if
you put it inside a recipe or on the right side of a recursive
variable assignment, it won=E2=80=99t be evaluated until later.  The
<var>text</var> will be expanded before the error is generated.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ifdef ERROR1
$(error error is $(ERROR1))
endif

<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ERR =3D $(error found an error!)

.PHONY: err

<span id=3D"index-command-expansion"></span>
<span id=3D"index-backquotes"></span>
<span id=3D"index-shell-command_002c-function-for"></span>

<p>The <code>shell</code> function is unlike any other function other than =
the
<code>wildcard</code> function
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard=
-Function">The Function <code>wildcard</code></a>) in that it
communicates with the world outside of <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>shell</code> function provides for <code>make</code> the same =
facility that
backquotes (=E2=80=98<samp>`</samp>=E2=80=99) provide in most shells: it do=
es <em>command expansion</em>.
This means that it takes as an argument a shell command and expands to the
output of the command.  The only processing <code>make</code> does on the r=
esult is
to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a single spa=
ce.
If there is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it will simply be
removed.
</p>
<p>The commands run by calls to the <code>shell</code> function are run whe=
n the
function calls are expanded (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/ma=
ke/manual/make.html#Reading-Makefiles">How <code>make</code> Reads
a Makefile</a>).  Because this function involves spawning a new shell, you =
should
carefully consider the performance implications of using the <code>shell</c=
ode>
function within recursively expanded variables vs. simply expanded variable=
s
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors"=
>The Two Flavors of Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>An alternative to the <code>shell</code> function is the =E2=80=98<samp>=
!=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 assignment
operator; it provides a similar behavior but has subtle differences
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting"=
>Setting Variables</a>).  The =E2=80=98<samp>!=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 assignmen=
t operator is
included in newer POSIX standards.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eSHELLSTATUS"></span>
<p>After the <code>shell</code> function or =E2=80=98<samp>!=3D</samp>=E2=
=80=99 assignment operator is
used, its exit status is placed in the <code>.SHELLSTATUS</code> variable.
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <code>shell</code> function:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">contents :=3D $(shell cat foo)
</pre></div>

<p>sets <code>contents</code> to the contents of the file <samp>foo</samp>,=
 with a space
(rather than a newline) separating each line.
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">files :=3D $(shell echo *.c)
</pre></div>

<p>sets <code>files</code> to the expansion of =E2=80=98<samp>*.c</samp>=E2=
=80=99.  Unless <code>make</code> is
using a very strange shell, this has the same result as
=E2=80=98<samp>$(wildcard&nbsp;*.c)</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> (as long as=
 at least one =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 file
exists).
</p>
<p>All variables that are marked as <code>export</code> will also be passed=
 to the
shell started by the <code>shell</code> function.  It is possible to create=
 a
variable expansion loop: consider this <samp>makefile</samp>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export HI =3D $(shell echo hi)
all: ; @echo $$HI
</pre></div>

<p>When <code>make</code> wants to run the recipe it must add the variable =
<var>HI</var> to
the environment; to do so it must be expanded.  The value of this variable
requires an invocation of the <code>shell</code> function, and to invoke it=
 we must
create its environment.  Since <var>HI</var> is exported, we need to expand=
 it to
create its environment.  And so on.  In this obscure case <code>make</code>=
 will use
the value of the variable from the environment provided to <code>make</code=
>, or
else the empty string if there was none, rather than looping or issuing an
error.  This is often what you want; for example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">export PATH =3D $(shell echo /usr/local/bin:$$PATH)
</pre></div>

<p>However, it would be simpler and more efficient to use a simply-expanded
variable here (=E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</samp>=E2=80=99) in the first place.

used as the expansion of the <code>guile</code> function in the makefile.

<p>A makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more
than one way.  The simplest use is to recompile every file that is out
of date.  Usually, makefiles are written so that if you run
<code>make</code> with no arguments, it does just that.
</p>
<p>But you might want to update only some of the files; you might want to u=
se
a different compiler or different compiler options; you might want just to
find out which files are out of date without changing them.
</p>
<p>By giving arguments when you run <code>make</code>, you can do any of th=
ese
things and many others.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-exit-status-of-make"></span>
<p>The exit status of <code>make</code> is always one of three values:
</p><dl compact=3D"compact">

<dd><p>The exit status is zero if <code>make</code> is successful.
</p></dd>

<dd><p>The exit status is two if <code>make</code> encounters any errors.
It will print messages describing the particular errors.

<dt><span><code>1</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>The exit status is one if you use the =E2=80=98<samp>-q</samp>=E2=80=

<p>The way to specify the name of the makefile is with the =E2=80=98<samp>-=
f</samp>=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--file</samp>=E2=80=99 option (=E2=80=98<samp>--makefile</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 also works).  For example,
=E2=80=98<samp>-f altmake</samp>=E2=80=99 says to use the file <samp>altmak=
e</samp> as the makefile.
</p>
<p>If you use the =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99 flag several times and =
follow each =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99
with an argument, all the specified files are used jointly as
makefiles.
</p>
<p>If you do not use the =E2=80=98<samp>-f</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<sam=
p>--file</samp>=E2=80=99 flag, the default is
to try <samp>GNUmakefile</samp>, <samp>makefile</samp>, and <samp>Makefile<=
/samp>, in
that order, and use the first of these three which exists or can be made
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefile=
s">Writing Makefiles</a>).

2 Arguments to Specify the Goals</h3>
<span id=3D"index-goal_002c-how-to-specify"></span>

<p>The <em>goals</em> are the targets that <code>make</code> should strive =
ultimately
to update.  Other targets are updated as well if they appear as
prerequisites of goals, or prerequisites of prerequisites of goals, etc.
</p>
<p>By default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting
targets that start with a period).  Therefore, makefiles are usually
written so that the first target is for compiling the entire program or
programs they describe.  If the first rule in the makefile has several
targets, only the first target in the rule becomes the default goal, not
the whole list.  You can manage the selection of the default goal from
within your makefile using the <code>.DEFAULT_GOAL</code> variable
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-=
Variables">Other Special Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>You can also specify a different goal or goals with command line
arguments to <code>make</code>.  Use the name of the goal as an argument.
If you specify several goals, <code>make</code> processes each of them in
turn, in the order you name them.
</p>
<p>Any target in the makefile may be specified as a goal (unless it
starts with =E2=80=98<samp>-</samp>=E2=80=99 or contains an =E2=80=98<samp>=
=3D</samp>=E2=80=99, in which case it will be
parsed as a switch or variable definition, respectively).  Even
targets not in the makefile may be specified, if <code>make</code> can find
implicit rules that say how to make them.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-MAKECMDGOALS"></span>
<p><code>Make</code> will set the special variable <code>MAKECMDGOALS</code=
> to the
list of goals you specified on the command line.  If no goals were given
on the command line, this variable is empty.  Note that this variable
should be used only in special circumstances.
</p>
<p>An example of appropriate use is to avoid including <samp>.d</samp> file=
s
during <code>clean</code> rules (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwar=
e/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Prerequisites">Generating Prerequisites A=
utomatically</a>), so
<code>make</code> won=E2=80=99t create them only to immediately remove them
again:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">sources =3D foo.c bar.c

ifeq (,$(filter clean,$(MAKECMDGOALS))
include $(sources:.c=3D.d)
endif
</pre></div>

<p>One use of specifying a goal is if you want to compile only a part of
the program, or only one of several programs.  Specify as a goal each
file that you wish to remake.  For example, consider a directory containing
several programs, with a makefile that starts like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.PHONY: all
all: size nm ld ar as
</pre></div>

<p>If you are working on the program <code>size</code>, you might want to s=
ay
=E2=80=98<samp>make&nbsp;size</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> so that only the =
files of that program are recompiled.
</p>
<p>Another use of specifying a goal is to make files that are not normally
made.  For example, there may be a file of debugging output, or a
version of the program that is compiled specially for testing, which has
a rule in the makefile but is not a prerequisite of the default goal.
</p>
<p>Another use of specifying a goal is to run the recipe associated with
a phony target (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>) or empty target (see <a href=3D"ht=
tps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Targets">Empty Targe=
t Files to Record Events</a>).  Many makefiles contain
a phony target named <samp>clean</samp> which deletes everything except sou=
rce
files.  Naturally, this is done only if you request it explicitly with
=E2=80=98<samp>make&nbsp;clean</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w -->.  Following is a=
 list of typical phony and empty
target names.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make=
.html#Standard-Targets">Standard Targets for Users</a>, for a detailed list=
 of all the
standard target names which GNU software packages use.

</li><li> Without the =E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>-=
q</samp>=E2=80=99 flag, when <code>make</code> is actually

<p>Note that the options =E2=80=98<samp>-p</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<sa=

<p>Sometimes you may have changed a source file but you do not want to
recompile all the files that depend on it.  For example, suppose you add
a macro or a declaration to a header file that many other files depend
on.  Being conservative, <code>make</code> assumes that any change in the
header file requires recompilation of all dependent files, but you know
that they do not need to be recompiled and you would rather not waste
the time waiting for them to compile.
</p>
<p>If you anticipate the problem before changing the header file, you can
use the =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 flag.  This flag tells <code>make=
</code> not to run the
recipes in the rules, but rather to mark the target up to date by
changing its last-modification date.  You would follow this procedure:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use the command =E2=80=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99 to recompile the s=
ource files that really
need recompilation, ensuring that the object files are up-to-date
before you begin.

</li><li> Make the changes in the header files.

</li><li> Use the command =E2=80=98<samp>make -t</samp>=E2=80=99 to mark al=
l the object files as
up to date.  The next time you run <code>make</code>, the changes in the
header files will not cause any recompilation.
</li></ol>

<p>If you have already changed the header file at a time when some files
do need recompilation, it is too late to do this.  Instead, you can
use the =E2=80=98<samp><span class=3D"nolinebreak">-o</span>&nbsp;<var>file=
</var></samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> flag, which marks a specified file as
=E2=80=9Cold=E2=80=9D (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/man=
ual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>).  This means
that the file itself will not be remade, and nothing else will be
remade on its account.  Follow this procedure:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Recompile the source files that need compilation for reasons independe=
nt
of the particular header file, with =E2=80=98<samp>make -o <var>headerfile<=
/var></samp>=E2=80=99.
If several header files are involved, use a separate =E2=80=98<samp>-o</sam=
p>=E2=80=99 option
for each header file.

</li><li> Touch all the object files with =E2=80=98<samp>make -t</samp>=E2=
=80=99.

<span id=3D"index-overriding-variables-with-arguments"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-overriding-with-arguments"></span>
<span id=3D"index-command-line-variables"></span>
<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-command-line"></span>

<p>An argument that contains =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 specifies t=
he value of a variable:
=E2=80=98<samp><var>v</var>=3D<var>x</var></samp>=E2=80=99 sets the value o=
f the variable <var>v</var> to <var>x</var>.
If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same
variable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been
<em>overridden</em> by the command line argument.
</p>
<p>The most common way to use this facility is to pass extra flags to
compilers.  For example, in a properly written makefile, the variable
<code>CFLAGS</code> is included in each recipe that runs the C compiler, so=
 a
file <samp>foo.c</samp> would be compiled something like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">cc -c $(CFLAGS) foo.c
</pre></div>

<p>Thus, whatever value you set for <code>CFLAGS</code> affects each compil=
ation
that occurs.  The makefile probably specifies the usual value for
<code>CFLAGS</code>, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">CFLAGS=3D-g
</pre></div>

<p>Each time you run <code>make</code>, you can override this value if you
wish.  For example, if you say =E2=80=98<samp>make CFLAGS=3D'-g -O'</samp>=
=E2=80=99, each C
compilation will be done with =E2=80=98<samp>cc -c -g -O</samp>=E2=80=99.  =
(This also
illustrates how you can use quoting in the shell to enclose spaces and
other special characters in the value of a variable when you override
it.)
</p>
<p>The variable <code>CFLAGS</code> is only one of many standard variables =
that
exist just so that you can change them this way.  See <a href=3D"https://ww=
w.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Variables">Variables Used=
 by Implicit Rules</a>, for a complete list.
</p>
<p>You can also program the makefile to look at additional variables of you=
r
own, giving the user the ability to control other aspects of how the
makefile works by changing the variables.
</p>
<p>When you override a variable with a command line argument, you can
define either a recursively-expanded variable or a simply-expanded
variable.  The examples shown above make a recursively-expanded
variable; to make a simply-expanded variable, write =E2=80=98<samp>:=3D</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>::=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 instead of =E2=80=98<samp>=3D</samp>=
=E2=80=99.  But, unless you want to include a
variable reference or function call in the <em>value</em> that you
specify, it makes no difference which kind of variable you create.
</p>
<p>There is one way that the makefile can change a variable that you have
overridden.  This is to use the <code>override</code> directive, which is a=
 line
that looks like this: =E2=80=98<samp>override <var>variable</var> =3D <var>=
value</var></samp>=E2=80=99
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Override=
-Directive">The <code>override</code> Directive</a>).

<span id=3D"index-testing-compilation"></span>
<span id=3D"index-compilation_002c-testing"></span>

<p>Normally, when an error happens in executing a shell command, <code>make=
</code>
gives up immediately, returning a nonzero status.  No further recipes are
executed for any target.  The error implies that the goal cannot be
correctly remade, and <code>make</code> reports this as soon as it knows.
</p>
<p>When you are compiling a program that you have just changed, this is not
what you want.  Instead, you would rather that <code>make</code> try compil=
ing
every file that can be tried, to show you as many compilation errors
as possible.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002dk-1"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002dkeep_002dgoing-1"></span>
<p>On these occasions, you should use the =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=99=
 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--keep-going</samp>=E2=80=99 flag.  This tells <code>make</c=
ode> to continue to
consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them
if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.  For
example, after an error in compiling one object file, =E2=80=98<samp>make -=
k</samp>=E2=80=99
will continue compiling other object files even though it already
knows that linking them will be impossible.  In addition to continuing
after failed shell commands, =E2=80=98<samp>make -k</samp>=E2=80=99 will co=
ntinue as much as
possible after discovering that it does not know how to make a target
or prerequisite file.  This will always cause an error message, but
without =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=99, it is a fatal error (see <a href=
=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Sum=
mary of Options</a>).
</p>
<p>The usual behavior of <code>make</code> assumes that your purpose is to =
get the
goals up to date; once <code>make</code> learns that this is impossible, it=
 might
as well report the failure immediately.  The =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=
=99 flag says that the
real purpose is to test as much as possible of the changes made in the
program, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can
correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This is why Emacs=E2=
=80=99
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd> command passes the =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=99=
 flag by default.

<span id=3D"index-implicit-rule"></span>
<span id=3D"index-rule_002c-implicit"></span>

<p>Certain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often.  For
example, one customary way to make an object file is from a C source file
using the C compiler, <code>cc</code>.
</p>
<p><em>Implicit rules</em> tell <code>make</code> how to use customary tech=
niques so
that you do not have to specify them in detail when you want to use
them.  For example, there is an implicit rule for C compilation.  File
names determine which implicit rules are run.  For example, C
compilation typically takes a <samp>.c</samp> file and makes a <samp>.o</sa=
mp> file.
So <code>make</code> applies the implicit rule for C compilation when it se=
es
this combination of file name endings.
</p>
<p>A chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, <code>make=
</code>
will remake a <samp>.o</samp> file from a <samp>.y</samp> file by way of a =
<samp>.c</samp> file.
</p>
<p>The built-in implicit rules use several variables in their recipes so
that, by changing the values of the variables, you can change the way the
implicit rule works.  For example, the variable <code>CFLAGS</code> control=
s the
flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C compilation.
</p>
<p>You can define your own implicit rules by writing <em>pattern rules</em>=
.
</p>
<p><em>Suffix rules</em> are a more limited way to define implicit rules.
Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are
retained for compatibility.

 Implicit Rules</h3>
<span id=3D"index-implicit-rule_002c-how-to-use"></span>
<span id=3D"index-rule_002c-implicit_002c-how-to-use"></span>

<p>To allow <code>make</code> to find a customary method for updating a tar=
get
file, all you have to do is refrain from specifying recipes yourself.
Either write a rule with no recipe, or don=E2=80=99t write a rule at all.
Then <code>make</code> will figure out which implicit rule to use based on
which kind of source file exists or can be made.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose the makefile looks like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo : foo.o bar.o
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
</pre></div>

<p>Because you mention <samp>foo.o</samp> but do not give a rule for it, <c=
ode>make</code>
will automatically look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it.
This happens whether or not the file <samp>foo.o</samp> currently exists.
</p>
<p>If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both a recipe and one or
more prerequisites (the source files).  You would want to write a rule
for <samp>foo.o</samp> with no recipe if you need to specify additional
prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot
supply.
</p>
<p>Each implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns.  Ther=
e may
be many implicit rules with the same target pattern.  For example, numerous
rules make =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 files: one, from a =E2=80=98<s=
amp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 file with the C compiler;
another, from a =E2=80=98<samp>.p</samp>=E2=80=99 file with the Pascal comp=
iler; and so on.  The rule
that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites exist or can be made.
So, if you have a file <samp>foo.c</samp>, <code>make</code> will run the C=
 compiler;
otherwise, if you have a file <samp>foo.p</samp>, <code>make</code> will ru=
n the Pascal
compiler; and so on.
</p>
<p>Of course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you
want <code>make</code> to use, and you know it will choose that one because=
 you
know which possible prerequisite files are supposed to exist.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Catalogue=
-of-Rules">Catalogue of Built-In Rules</a>,
for a catalogue of all the predefined implicit rules.
</p>
<p>Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites =
=E2=80=9Cexist
or can be made=E2=80=9D.  A file =E2=80=9Ccan be made=E2=80=9D if it is men=
tioned explicitly in
the makefile as a target or a prerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be
recursively found for how to make it.  When an implicit prerequisite is the
result of another implicit rule, we say that <em>chaining</em> is occurring=
.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Chained-R=
ules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>In general, <code>make</code> searches for an implicit rule for each tar=
get, and
for each double-colon rule, that has no recipe.  A file that is mentioned
only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing,
so implicit rule search happens for it.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org=
/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rule-Search">Implicit Rule Search =
Algorithm</a>, for the
details of how the search is done.
</p>
<p>Note that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule search.
For example, consider this explicit rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o: foo.p
</pre></div>

<p>The prerequisite on <samp>foo.p</samp> does not necessarily mean that
<code>make</code> will remake <samp>foo.o</samp> according to the implicit =
rule to
make an object file, a <samp>.o</samp> file, from a Pascal source file, a
<samp>.p</samp> file.  For example, if <samp>foo.c</samp> also exists, the =
implicit
rule to make an object file from a C source file is used instead,
because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined
implicit rules (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#Catalogue-of-Rules">Catalogue of Built-In
Rules</a>).
</p>
<p>If you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no
recipe, you can give that target an empty recipe by writing a semicolon
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Re=
cipes">Defining Empty Recipes</a>).

<p>Here is a catalogue of predefined implicit rules which are always
available unless the makefile explicitly overrides or cancels them.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Canceling=
-Rules">Canceling Implicit Rules</a>, for information on
canceling or overriding an implicit rule.  The =E2=80=98<samp>-r</samp>=E2=
=80=99 or
=E2=80=98<samp>--no-builtin-rules</samp>=E2=80=99 option cancels all predef=
ined rules.
</p>
<p>This manual only documents the default rules available on POSIX-based
operating systems.  Other operating systems, such as VMS, Windows,
OS/2, etc. may have different sets of default rules.  To see the full
list of default rules and variables available in your version of GNU
<code>make</code>, run =E2=80=98<samp>make -p</samp>=E2=80=99 in a director=
y with no makefile.
</p>
<p>Not all of these rules will always be defined, even when the =E2=80=98<s=
amp>-r</samp>=E2=80=99
option is not given.  Many of the predefined implicit rules are
implemented in <code>make</code> as suffix rules, so which ones will be
defined depends on the <em>suffix list</em> (the list of prerequisites of
the special target <code>.SUFFIXES</code>).  The default suffix list is:
<code>.out</code>, <code>.a</code>, <code>.ln</code>, <code>.o</code>, <cod=
e>.c</code>, <code>.cc</code>,
<code>.C</code>, <code>.cpp</code>, <code>.p</code>, <code>.f</code>, <code=
>.F</code>, <code>.m</code>,
<code>.r</code>, <code>.y</code>, <code>.l</code>, <code>.ym</code>, <code>=
.lm</code>, <code>.s</code>,
<code>.S</code>, <code>.mod</code>, <code>.sym</code>, <code>.def</code>, <=
code>.h</code>,
<code>.info</code>, <code>.dvi</code>, <code>.tex</code>, <code>.texinfo</c=
ode>, <code>.texi</code>,
<code>.txinfo</code>, <code>.w</code>, <code>.ch</code> <code>.web</code>, =
<code>.sh</code>,
<code>.elc</code>, <code>.el</code>.  All of the implicit rules described b=
elow
whose prerequisites have one of these suffixes are actually suffix
rules.  If you modify the suffix list, the only predefined suffix
rules in effect will be those named by one or two of the suffixes that
are on the list you specify; rules whose suffixes fail to be on the
list are disabled.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual=
/make.html#Suffix-Rules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>,
for full details on suffix rules.

<p>This rule does the right thing for a simple program with only one
source file.  It will also do the right thing if there are multiple
object files (presumably coming from various other source files), one
of which has a name matching that of the executable file.  Thus,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">x: y.o z.o
</pre></div>

<p>when <samp>x.c</samp>, <samp>y.c</samp> and <samp>z.c</samp> all exist w=
ill execute:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">cc -c x.c -o x.o
cc -c y.c -o y.o
cc -c z.c -o z.o
cc x.o y.o z.o -o x
rm -f x.o
rm -f y.o
rm -f z.o
</pre></div>

<p>In more complicated cases, such as when there is no object file whose
name derives from the executable file name, you must write an explicit
recipe for linking.
</p>
<p>Each kind of file automatically made into =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=
=99 object files will
be automatically linked by using the compiler (=E2=80=98<samp>$(CC)</samp>=
=E2=80=99,
=E2=80=98<samp>$(FC)</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>$(PC)</samp>=E2=80=
=99; the C compiler =E2=80=98<samp>$(CC)</samp>=E2=80=99 is used to
assemble =E2=80=98<samp>.s</samp>=E2=80=99 files) without the =E2=80=98<sam=

done by using the =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 object files as interme=
diates, but it is
faster to do the compiling and linking in one step, so that=E2=80=99s how i=

<p>Usually, you want to change only the variables listed in the table
above, which are documented in the following section.
</p>
<p>However, the recipes in built-in implicit rules actually use
variables such as <code>COMPILE.c</code>, <code>LINK.p</code>, and
<code>PREPROCESS.S</code>, whose values contain the recipes listed above.
</p>
<p><code>make</code> follows the convention that the rule to compile a
<samp>.<var>x</var></samp> source file uses the variable <code>COMPILE.<var=
>x</var></code>.
Similarly, the rule to produce an executable from a <samp>.<var>x</var></sa=
mp>
file uses <code>LINK.<var>x</var></code>; and the rule to preprocess a
<samp>.<var>x</var></samp> file uses <code>PREPROCESS.<var>x</var></code>.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-OUTPUT_005fOPTION"></span>
<p>Every rule that produces an object file uses the variable
<code>OUTPUT_OPTION</code>.  <code>make</code> defines this variable either=
 to
contain =E2=80=98<samp>-o $@</samp>=E2=80=99, or to be empty, depending on =
a compile-time
option.  You need the =E2=80=98<samp>-o</samp>=E2=80=99 option to ensure th=
at the output goes
into the right file when the source file is in a different directory,
as when using <code>VPATH</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwa=
re/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search">Searching Directories for Prereq=
uisites</a>).  However,
compilers on some systems do not accept a =E2=80=98<samp>-o</samp>=E2=80=99=
 switch for object
files.  If you use such a system, and use <code>VPATH</code>, some
compilations will put their output in the wrong place.
A possible workaround for this problem is to give <code>OUTPUT_OPTION</code=
>
the value =E2=80=98<samp>;&nbsp;mv&nbsp;$*.o&nbsp;$@</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@=
w -->.

10.3 Variables Used by Implicit Rules</h3>
<span id=3D"index-flags-for-compilers"></span>

<p>The recipes in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain
predefined variables.  You can alter the values of these variables in
the makefile, with arguments to <code>make</code>, or in the environment to
alter how the implicit rules work without redefining the rules
themselves.  You can cancel all variables used by implicit rules with
the =E2=80=98<samp>-R</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--no-builtin-variab=
les</samp>=E2=80=99 option.
</p>
<p>For example, the recipe used to compile a C source file actually says
=E2=80=98<samp>$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)</samp>=E2=80=99.  The default=
 values of the variables
used are =E2=80=98<samp>cc</samp>=E2=80=99 and nothing, resulting in the co=
mmand =E2=80=98<samp>cc -c</samp>=E2=80=99.  By
redefining =E2=80=98<samp>CC</samp>=E2=80=99 to =E2=80=98<samp>ncc</samp>=
=E2=80=99, you could cause =E2=80=98<samp>ncc</samp>=E2=80=99 to be
used for all C compilations performed by the implicit rule.  By redefining
=E2=80=98<samp>CFLAGS</samp>=E2=80=99 to be =E2=80=98<samp>-g</samp>=E2=80=
=99, you could pass the =E2=80=98<samp>-g</samp>=E2=80=99 option to
each compilation.  <em>All</em> implicit rules that do C compilation use
=E2=80=98<samp>$(CC)</samp>=E2=80=99 to get the program name for the compil=
er and <em>all</em>
include =E2=80=98<samp>$(CFLAGS)</samp>=E2=80=99 among the arguments given =
to the compiler.
</p>
<p>The variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those that a=
re
names of programs (like <code>CC</code>) and those that contain arguments f=
or the
programs (like <code>CFLAGS</code>).  (The =E2=80=9Cname of a program=E2=80=
=9D may also contain
some command arguments, but it must start with an actual executable program
name.)  If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate them
with spaces.
</p>
<p>The following tables describe of some of the more commonly-used predefin=
ed
variables.  This list is not exhaustive, and the default values shown here =
may
not be what <code>make</code> selects for your environment.  To see the
complete list of predefined variables for your instance of GNU <code>make</=
code> you
can run =E2=80=98<samp>make -p</samp>=E2=80=99 in a directory with no makef=
iles.
</p>

programs in built-in rules:

<span id=3D"Chains-of-Implicit-Rules"></span><h3 class=3D"section">10.4 Cha=
ins of Implicit Rules</h3>

<span id=3D"index-chains-of-rules"></span>
<span id=3D"index-rule_002c-implicit_002c-chains-of"></span>
<p>Sometimes a file can be made by a sequence of implicit rules.  For examp=
le,
a file <samp><var>n</var>.o</samp> could be made from <samp><var>n</var>.y<=
/samp> by running
first Yacc and then <code>cc</code>.  Such a sequence is called a <em>chain=
</em>.
</p>
<p>If the file <samp><var>n</var>.c</samp> exists, or is mentioned in the m=
akefile, no
special searching is required: <code>make</code> finds that the object file=
 can
be made by C compilation from <samp><var>n</var>.c</samp>; later on, when c=
onsidering
how to make <samp><var>n</var>.c</samp>, the rule for running Yacc is
used.  Ultimately both <samp><var>n</var>.c</samp> and <samp><var>n</var>.o=
</samp> are
updated.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-intermediate-files"></span>
<span id=3D"index-files_002c-intermediate"></span>
<p>However, even if <samp><var>n</var>.c</samp> does not exist and is not m=
entioned,
<code>make</code> knows how to envision it as the missing link between
<samp><var>n</var>.o</samp> and <samp><var>n</var>.y</samp>!  In this case,=
 <samp><var>n</var>.c</samp> is
called an <em>intermediate file</em>.  Once <code>make</code> has decided t=
o use the
intermediate file, it is entered in the data base as if it had been
mentioned in the makefile, along with the implicit rule that says how to
create it.
</p>
<p>Intermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other
files.  But intermediate files are treated differently in two ways.
</p>
<p>The first difference is what happens if the intermediate file does not
exist.  If an ordinary file <var>b</var> does not exist, and <code>make</co=
de>
considers a target that depends on <var>b</var>, it invariably creates
<var>b</var> and then updates the target from <var>b</var>.  But if <var>b<=
/var> is
an intermediate file, then <code>make</code> can leave well enough alone:
it won=E2=80=99t create <var>b</var> unless one of its prerequisites is out=
 of
date.  This means the target depending on <var>b</var> won=E2=80=99t be reb=
uilt
either, unless there is some other reason to update that target: for
example the target doesn=E2=80=99t exist or a different prerequisite is new=
er
than the target.
</p>
<p>The second difference is that if <code>make</code> <em>does</em> create =
<var>b</var> in
order to update something else, it deletes <var>b</var> later on after it i=
s no
longer needed.  Therefore, an intermediate file which did not exist before
<code>make</code> also does not exist after <code>make</code>.  <code>make<=
/code> reports the
deletion to you by printing a =E2=80=98<samp>rm</samp>=E2=80=99 command sho=
wing which file it is
deleting.
</p>
<p>You can explicitly mark a file as intermediate by listing it as a prereq=
uisite
of the special target <code>.INTERMEDIATE</code>.  This takes effect even i=
f the
file is mentioned explicitly in some other way.
</p>
<p>A file cannot be intermediate if it is mentioned in the makefile as a ta=
rget
or prerequisite, so one way to avoid the deletion of intermediate files is =
by
adding it as a prerequisite to some target.  However, doing so can cause ma=
ke
to do extra work when searching pattern rules (see <a href=3D"https://www.g=
nu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rule-Search">Implicit Rule S=
earch Algorithm</a>).
</p>
<p>As an alternative, listing a file as a prerequisite of the special targe=
t
<code>.NOTINTERMEDIATE</code> forces it to not be considered intermediate (=
just as
any other mention of the file will do).  Also, listing the target pattern o=
f a
pattern rule as a prerequisite of <code>.NOTINTERMEDIATE</code> ensures tha=
t no
targets generated using that pattern rule are considered intermediate.
</p>
<p>You can disable intermediate files completely in your makefile by
providing <code>.NOTINTERMEDIATE</code> as a target with no prerequisites:
in that case it applies to every file in the makefile.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-intermediate-files_002c-preserving"></span>
<span id=3D"index-preserving-intermediate-files"></span>
<span id=3D"index-secondary-files"></span>
<p>If you do not want <code>make</code> to create a file merely because it =
does
not already exist, but you also do not want <code>make</code> to
automatically delete the file, you can mark it as a <em>secondary</em>
file.  To do this, list it as a prerequisite of the special target
<code>.SECONDARY</code>.  Marking a file as secondary also marks it as
intermediate.
</p>
<p>A chain can involve more than two implicit rules.  For example, it is
possible to make a file <samp>foo</samp> from <samp>RCS/foo.y,v</samp> by r=
unning RCS,
Yacc and <code>cc</code>.  Then both <samp>foo.y</samp> and <samp>foo.c</sa=
mp> are
intermediate files that are deleted at the end.
</p>
<p>No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain.  This mean=
s
that <code>make</code> will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as ma=
king
<samp>foo</samp> from <samp>foo.o.o</samp> by running the linker twice.  Th=
is
constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the
search for an implicit rule chain.
</p>
<p>There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that wou=
ld
otherwise be handled by rule chains.  For example, making <samp>foo</samp> =
from
<samp>foo.c</samp> could be handled by compiling and linking with separate
chained rules, using <samp>foo.o</samp> as an intermediate file.  But what
actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the compilation
and linking with a single <code>cc</code> command.  The optimized rule is u=
sed in
preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes earlier in the
ordering of rules.
</p>
<p>Finally, for performance reasons <code>make</code> will not consider non=
-terminal
match-anything rules (i.e., =E2=80=98<samp>%:</samp>=E2=80=99) when searchi=
ng for a rule to
build a prerequisite of an implicit rule (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.or=
g/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything P=
attern Rules</a>).

<span id=3D"Defining-and-Redefining-Pattern-Rules"></span><h3 class=3D"sect=
ion">10.5 Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</h3>

<p>You define an implicit rule by writing a <em>pattern rule</em>.  A patte=
rn
rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the
character =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 (exactly one of them).  The targ=
et is considered a
pattern for matching file names; the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 can m=
atch any nonempty
substring, while other characters match only themselves.  The prerequisites
likewise use =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 to show how their names relat=
e to the target name.
</p>
<p>Thus, a pattern rule =E2=80=98<samp>%.o : %.c</samp>=E2=80=99 says how t=
o make any file
<samp><var>stem</var>.o</samp> from another file <samp><var>stem</var>.c</s=
amp>.
</p>
<p>Note that expansion using =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in pattern ru=
les occurs
<strong>after</strong> any variable or function expansions, which take plac=
e
when the makefile is read.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=

10.5.1 Introduction to Pattern Rules</h4>
<span id=3D"index-pattern-rule"></span>
<span id=3D"index-rule_002c-pattern"></span>

<p>A pattern rule contains the character =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 (=
exactly one of them)
in the target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule.  The
target is a pattern for matching file names; the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=
=80=99 matches any
nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves.
<span id=3D"index-target-pattern_002c-implicit"></span>
<span id=3D"index-_0025_002c-in-pattern-rules"></span>
</p>
<p>For example, =E2=80=98<samp>%.c</samp>=E2=80=99 as a pattern matches any=
 file name that ends in
=E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99.  =E2=80=98<samp>s.%.c</samp>=E2=80=99 as=
 a pattern matches any file name that starts
with =E2=80=98<samp>s.</samp>=E2=80=99, ends in =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=
=80=99 and is at least five characters long.
(There must be at least one character to match the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=
=E2=80=99.)  The substring
that the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 matches is called the <em>stem</e=
m>.
</p>
<p>=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in a prerequisite of a pattern rule sta=
nds for the same stem
that was matched by the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in the target.  In=
 order for the
pattern rule to apply, its target pattern must match the file name
under consideration and all of its prerequisites (after pattern
substitution) must name files that exist or can be made.  These files
become prerequisites of the target.
<span id=3D"index-prerequisite-pattern_002c-implicit"></span>
</p>
<p>Thus, a rule of the form
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.o : %.c ; <var>recipe</var>=E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p>specifies how to make a file <samp><var>n</var>.o</samp>, with another f=
ile
<samp><var>n</var>.c</samp> as its prerequisite, provided that <samp><var>n=
</var>.c</samp>
exists or can be made.
</p>
<p>There may also be prerequisites that do not use =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=
=E2=80=99; such a prerequisite
attaches to every file made by this pattern rule.  These unvarying
prerequisites are useful occasionally.
</p>
<p>A pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain =E2=80=98<sa=
mp>%</samp>=E2=80=99, or
in fact any prerequisites at all.  Such a rule is effectively a general
wildcard.  It provides a way to make any file that matches the target
pattern.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=
#Last-Resort">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>More than one pattern rule may match a target.  In this case
<code>make</code> will choose the =E2=80=9Cbest fit=E2=80=9D rule.  See <a =
href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Match">H=
ow Patterns Match</a>.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-multiple-targets_002c-in-pattern-rule"></span>
<span id=3D"index-target_002c-multiple-in-pattern-rule"></span>
<p>Pattern rules may have more than one target; however, every target must
contain a <code>%</code> character.  Multiple target patterns in pattern ru=
les are
always treated as grouped targets (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softw=
are/make/manual/make.html#Multiple-Targets">Multiple Targets
in a Rule</a>) regardless of whether they use the <code>:</code> or <code>&=
amp;:</code>
separator.
</p>
<p>There is one exception: if a pattern target is out of date or does
not exist and the makefile does not need to build it, then it will not caus=
e
the other targets to be considered out of date.  Note that this historical
exception will be removed in future versions of GNU <code>make</code> and s=
hould not
be relied on.  If this situation is detected <code>make</code> will generat=
e a
warning <em>pattern recipe did not update peer target</em>; however, <code>=
make</code>
cannot detect all such situations.  Please be sure that your recipe updates
<em>all</em> the target patterns when it runs.

<span id=3D"Pattern-Rule-Examples"></span><h4 class=3D"subsection">10.5.2 P=
attern Rule Examples</h4>

<p>Here are some examples of pattern rules actually predefined in
<code>make</code>.  First, the rule that compiles =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=
=E2=80=99 files into =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99
files:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.o : %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
</pre></div>

<p>defines a rule that can make any file <samp><var>x</var>.o</samp> from
<samp><var>x</var>.c</samp>.  The recipe uses the automatic variables =E2=
=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 and
=E2=80=98<samp>$&lt;</samp>=E2=80=99 to substitute the names of the target =
file and the source file
in each case where the rule applies (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/sof=
tware/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>).
</p>
<p>Here is a second built-in rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">% :: RCS/%,v
        $(CO) $(COFLAGS) $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>defines a rule that can make any file <samp><var>x</var></samp> whatsoev=
er from a
corresponding file <samp><var>x</var>,v</samp> in the sub-directory <samp>R=
CS</samp>.  Since
the target is =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99, this rule will apply to any=
 file whatever, provided
the appropriate prerequisite file exists.  The double colon makes the rule
<em>terminal</em>, which means that its prerequisite may not be an intermed=
iate
file (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Mat=
ch_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</a>).
</p>
<p>This pattern rule has two targets:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.tab.c %.tab.h: %.y
        bison -d $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>This tells <code>make</code> that the recipe =E2=80=98<samp>bison -d <va=
r>x</var>.y</samp>=E2=80=99 will
make both <samp><var>x</var>.tab.c</samp> and <samp><var>x</var>.tab.h</sam=
p>.  If the file
<samp>foo</samp> depends on the files <samp>parse.tab.o</samp> and <samp>sc=
an.o</samp>
and the file <samp>scan.o</samp> depends on the file <samp>parse.tab.h</sam=
p>,
when <samp>parse.y</samp> is changed, the recipe =E2=80=98<samp>bison -d pa=
rse.y</samp>=E2=80=99
will be executed only once, and the prerequisites of both
<samp>parse.tab.o</samp> and <samp>scan.o</samp> will be satisfied.  (Presu=
mably
the file <samp>parse.tab.o</samp> will be recompiled from <samp>parse.tab.c=
</samp>
and the file <samp>scan.o</samp> from <samp>scan.c</samp>, while <samp>foo<=
/samp> is
linked from <samp>parse.tab.o</samp>, <samp>scan.o</samp>, and its other
prerequisites, and it will execute happily ever after.)

<span id=3D"index-variables_002c-automatic"></span>

<p>Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a =E2=80=98<samp>.c</s=
amp>=E2=80=99 file into a
=E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 file: how do you write the =E2=80=98<samp=
>cc</samp>=E2=80=99 command so that it operates
on the right source file name?  You cannot write the name in the recipe,
because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.
</p>
<p>What you do is use a special feature of <code>make</code>, the <em>autom=
atic
variables</em>.  These variables have values computed afresh for each rule =
that
is executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule.  In this
example, you would use =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 for the object fil=
e name and =E2=80=98<samp>$&lt;</samp>=E2=80=99
for the source file name.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-automatic-variables-in-prerequisites"></span>
<span id=3D"index-prerequisites_002c-and-automatic-variables"></span>
<p>It=E2=80=99s very important that you recognize the limited scope in whic=
h
automatic variable values are available: they only have values within
the recipe.  In particular, you cannot use them anywhere
within the target list of a rule; they have no value there and will
expand to the empty string.  Also, they cannot be accessed directly
within the prerequisite list of a rule.  A common mistake is
attempting to use <code>$@</code> within the prerequisites list; this will
not work.  However, there is a special feature of GNU <code>make</code>,
secondary expansion (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manua=
l/make.html#Secondary-Expansion">Secondary Expansion</a>), which will allow
automatic variable values to be used in prerequisite lists.
</p>
<p>Here is a table of automatic variables:

<span id=3D"index-_0040-_0028automatic-variable_0029"></span>
</dd>

<dd><p>The file name of the target of the rule.  If the target is an archiv=
e
member, then =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 is the name of the archive f=
ile.  In a pattern
rule that has multiple targets (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software=
/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Intro">Introduction to
Pattern Rules</a>), =E2=80=98<samp>$@</samp>=E2=80=99 is the name of whiche=

.
</p>
<p>=E2=80=98<samp>$?</samp>=E2=80=99 is useful even in explicit rules when =
you wish to operate on only
the prerequisites that have changed.  For example, suppose that an archive
named <samp>lib</samp> is supposed to contain copies of several object file=
s.
This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
        ar r lib $?

prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archives=
">Using <code>make</code> to Update Archive Files</a>).  A target has only =
one prerequisite on each other file
it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a
prerequisite.  So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target,
the value of <code>$^</code> contains just one copy of the name.  This list
does <strong>not</strong> contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for =
those
see the =E2=80=98<samp>$|</samp>=E2=80=99 variable, below.

<dd><p>The stem with which an implicit rule matches (see <a href=3D"https:/=

<span id=3D"index-stem_002c-variable-for"></span>
</p>
<p>In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched
the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in the target pattern.
</p>
<p>In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so =E2=80=98<samp>$*</samp>=E2=80=

in that way.  Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Suffix-R=
ules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>), =E2=80=98<samp>$*</samp>=E2=80=99 is=
 set to
the target name minus the suffix.  For example, if the target name is
=E2=80=98<samp>foo.c</samp>=E2=80=99, then =E2=80=98<samp>$*</samp>=E2=80=
=99 is set to =E2=80=98<samp>foo</samp>=E2=80=99, since =E2=80=98<samp>.c</=
samp>=E2=80=99 is a
suffix.  GNU <code>make</code> does this bizarre thing only for compatibili=
ty
with other implementations of <code>make</code>.  You should generally avoi=
d
using =E2=80=98<samp>$*</samp>=E2=80=99 except in implicit rules or static =
pattern rules.
</p>
<p>If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a recognized
suffix, =E2=80=98<samp>$*</samp>=E2=80=99 is set to the empty string for th=
at rule.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file
names, and three have values that are lists of file names.  These
seven have variants that get just the file=E2=80=99s directory name or just
the file name within the directory.  The variant variables=E2=80=99 names a=
re
formed by appending =E2=80=98<samp>D</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>F</s=

however, that the =E2=80=98<samp>D</samp>=E2=80=99 variants all omit the tr=

=E2=80=9Cthe&nbsp;variable&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>=E2=80=9D<!-- /@w --> as w=

looks more natural in this special case.  Please do not assume it has a
deep significance; =E2=80=98<samp>$&lt;</samp>=E2=80=99 refers to the varia=

as =E2=80=98<samp>$(CFLAGS)</samp>=E2=80=99 refers to the variable named <c=

<span id=3D"How-Patterns-Match"></span><h4 class=3D"subsection">10.5.4 How =
Patterns Match</h4>

<span id=3D"index-stem-1"></span>
<p>A target pattern is composed of a =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 betwe=
en a prefix and a suffix,
either or both of which may be empty.  The pattern matches a file name only
if the file name starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix, without
overlap.  The text between the prefix and the suffix is called the
<em>stem</em>.  Thus, when the pattern =E2=80=98<samp>%.o</samp>=E2=80=99 m=
atches the file name
<samp>test.o</samp>, the stem is =E2=80=98<samp>test</samp>=E2=80=99.  The =
pattern rule prerequisites are
turned into actual file names by substituting the stem for the character
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99.  Thus, if in the same example one of the =
prerequisites is written
as =E2=80=98<samp>%.c</samp>=E2=80=99, it expands to =E2=80=98<samp>test.c<=
/samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>When the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does
not), directory names in the file names are removed from the file name
before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix.  After the
comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory
names, along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the
prerequisite file names generated from the pattern rule=E2=80=99s prerequis=
ite
patterns and the file name.  The directories are ignored only for the
purpose of finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of
that rule.  Thus, =E2=80=98<samp>e%t</samp>=E2=80=99 matches the file name =
<samp>src/eat</samp>,
with =E2=80=98<samp>src/a</samp>=E2=80=99 as the stem.  When prerequisites =
are turned into file
names, the directories from the stem are added at the front, while the
rest of the stem is substituted for the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99.  =
The stem
=E2=80=98<samp>src/a</samp>=E2=80=99 with a prerequisite pattern =E2=80=98<=
samp>c%r</samp>=E2=80=99 gives the file name
<samp>src/car</samp>.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-pattern-rules_002c-order-of"></span>
<span id=3D"index-order-of-pattern-rules"></span>
<p>A pattern rule can be used to build a given file only if there is a
target pattern that matches the file name, <em>and</em> all
prerequisites in that rule either exist or can be built.  The rules
you write take precedence over those that are built in. Note however,
that a rule which can be satisfied without chaining other implicit
rules (for example, one which has no prerequisites or its
prerequisites already exist or are mentioned) always takes priority
over a rule with prerequisites that must be made by chaining other
implicit rules.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-stem_002c-shortest"></span>
<p>It is possible that more than one pattern rule will meet these
criteria.  In that case, <code>make</code> will choose the rule with the
shortest stem (that is, the pattern that matches most specifically).
If more than one pattern rule has the shortest stem, <code>make</code> will
choose the first one found in the makefile.
</p>
<p>This algorithm results in more specific rules being preferred over
more generic ones; for example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@

%.o : %.f
        $(COMPILE.F) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $&lt;

lib/%.o: lib/%.c
        $(CC) -fPIC -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
</pre></div>

<p>Given these rules and asked to build <samp>bar.o</samp> where both
<samp>bar.c</samp> and <samp>bar.f</samp> exist, <code>make</code> will cho=
ose the first
rule and compile <samp>bar.c</samp> into <samp>bar.o</samp>.  In the same
situation where <samp>bar.c</samp> does not exist, then <code>make</code> w=
ill
choose the second rule and compile <samp>bar.f</samp> into <samp>bar.o</sam=
p>.
</p>
<p>If <code>make</code> is asked to build <samp>lib/bar.o</samp> and both
<samp>lib/bar.c</samp> and <samp>lib/bar.f</samp> exist, then the third rul=
e will
be chosen since the stem for this rule (=E2=80=98<samp>bar</samp>=E2=80=99)=
 is shorter than
the stem for the first rule (=E2=80=98<samp>lib/bar</samp>=E2=80=99).  If <=
samp>lib/bar.c</samp>
does not exist then the third rule is not eligible and the second rule
will be used, even though the stem is longer.

<span id=3D"index-match_002danything-rule"></span>
<span id=3D"index-terminal-rule"></span>
<p>When a pattern rule=E2=80=99s target is just =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=
=80=99, it matches any file name
whatever.  We call these rules <em>match-anything</em> rules.  They are ver=
y
useful, but it can take a lot of time for <code>make</code> to think about =
them,
because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed either
as a target or as a prerequisite.
</p>
<p>Suppose the makefile mentions <samp>foo.c</samp>.  For this target, <cod=
e>make</code>
would have to consider making it by linking an object file <samp>foo.c.o</s=
amp>,
or by C compilation-and-linking in one step from <samp>foo.c.c</samp>, or b=
y
Pascal compilation-and-linking from <samp>foo.c.p</samp>, and many other
possibilities.
</p>
<p>We know these possibilities are ridiculous since <samp>foo.c</samp> is a=
 C source
file, not an executable.  If <code>make</code> did consider these possibili=
ties,
it would ultimately reject them, because files such as <samp>foo.c.o</samp>=
 and
<samp>foo.c.p</samp> would not exist.  But these possibilities are so
numerous that <code>make</code> would run very slowly if it had to consider
them.
</p>
<p>To gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way <code>make</co=
de>
considers match-anything rules.  There are two different constraints that
can be applied, and each time you define a match-anything rule you must
choose one or the other for that rule.
</p>
<p>One choice is to mark the match-anything rule as <em>terminal</em> by de=
fining
it with a double colon.  When a rule is terminal, it does not apply unless
its prerequisites actually exist.  Prerequisites that could be made with
other implicit rules are not good enough.  In other words, no further
chaining is allowed beyond a terminal rule.
</p>
<p>For example, the built-in implicit rules for extracting sources from RCS
and SCCS files are terminal; as a result, if the file <samp>foo.c,v</samp> =
does
not exist, <code>make</code> will not even consider trying to make it as an
intermediate file from <samp>foo.c,v.o</samp> or from <samp>RCS/SCCS/s.foo.=
c,v</samp>.
RCS and SCCS files are generally ultimate source files, which should not be
remade from any other files; therefore, <code>make</code> can save time by =
not
looking for ways to remake them.
</p>
<p>If you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is
non-terminal.  A non-terminal match-anything rule cannot apply to a
prerequisite of an implicit rule, or to a file name that indicates a
specific type of data.  A file name indicates a specific type of data
if some non-match-anything implicit rule target matches it.
</p>
<p>For example, the file name <samp>foo.c</samp> matches the target for the=
 pattern
rule =E2=80=98<samp>%.c : %.y</samp>=E2=80=99 (the rule to run Yacc).  Rega=
rdless of whether this
rule is actually applicable (which happens only if there is a file
<samp>foo.y</samp>), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent
consideration of any non-terminal match-anything rules for the file
<samp>foo.c</samp>.  Thus, <code>make</code> will not even consider trying =
to make
<samp>foo.c</samp> as an executable file from <samp>foo.c.o</samp>, <samp>f=
oo.c.c</samp>,
<samp>foo.c.p</samp>, etc.
</p>
<p>The motivation for this constraint is that non-terminal match-anything
rules are used for making files containing specific types of data (such as
executable files) and a file name with a recognized suffix indicates some
other specific type of data (such as a C source file).
</p>
<p>Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize
certain file names so that non-terminal match-anything rules will not be
considered.  These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no recipes, and
they are ignored for all other purposes.  For example, the built-in
implicit rule
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.p :
</pre></div>

<p>exists to make sure that Pascal source files such as <samp>foo.p</samp> =
match a
specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted looking
for <samp>foo.p.o</samp> or <samp>foo.p.c</samp>.
</p>
<p>Dummy pattern rules such as the one for =E2=80=98<samp>%.p</samp>=E2=80=
=99 are made for every
suffix listed as valid for use in suffix rules (see <a href=3D"https://www.=

ules</a>).

6 Canceling Implicit Rules</h4>

<p>You can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined
yourself) by defining a new pattern rule with the same target and
prerequisites, but a different recipe.  When the new rule is defined, the
built-in one is replaced.  The new rule=E2=80=99s position in the sequence =
of
implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.
</p>
<p>You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule with =
the
same target and prerequisites, but no recipe.  For example, the following
would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:

<span id=3D"index-default-rules_002c-last_002dresort"></span>

<p>You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal
match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (see <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-A=
nything Pattern Rules</a>).  This is just like any other pattern rule; the =
only thing
special about it is that it will match any target.  So such a rule=E2=80=99=
s
recipe is used for all targets and prerequisites that have no recipe
of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.
</p>
<p>For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source
files contain real data, only that they exist.  Then you might do this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%::
        touch $@
</pre></div>

<p>to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created
automatically.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eDEFAULT-1"></span>
<p>You can instead define a recipe to be used for targets for which there
are no rules at all, even ones which don=E2=80=99t specify recipes.  You do
this by writing a rule for the target <code>.DEFAULT</code>.  Such a rule=
=E2=80=99s
recipe is used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets in
any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies.  Naturally,
there is no <code>.DEFAULT</code> rule unless you write one.
</p>
<p>If you use <code>.DEFAULT</code> with no recipe or prerequisites:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.DEFAULT:
</pre></div>

<p>the recipe previously stored for <code>.DEFAULT</code> is cleared.  Then
<code>make</code> acts as if you had never defined <code>.DEFAULT</code> at=
 all.
</p>
<p>If you do not want a target to get the recipe from a match-anything
pattern rule or <code>.DEFAULT</code>, but you also do not want any recipe
to be run for the target, you can give it an empty recipe
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Re=
cipes">Defining Empty Recipes</a>).
</p>
<p>You can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile.

.7 Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</h3>
<span id=3D"index-old_002dfashioned-suffix-rules"></span>
<span id=3D"index-suffix-rule"></span>

<p><em>Suffix rules</em> are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rul=
es for
<code>make</code>.  Suffix rules are obsolete because pattern rules are mor=
e
general and clearer.  They are supported in GNU <code>make</code> for
compatibility with old makefiles.  They come in two kinds:
<em>double-suffix</em> and <em>single-suffix</em>.
</p>
<p>A double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target
suffix and the source suffix.  It matches any file whose name ends
with the target suffix.  The corresponding implicit prerequisite is
made by replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the file
name.  A two-suffix rule =E2=80=98<samp>.c.o</samp>=E2=80=99 (whose target =
and source suffixes
are =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99=
) is equivalent to the pattern rule
=E2=80=98<samp>%.o : %.c</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>A single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the source
suffix.  It matches any file name, and the corresponding implicit
prerequisite name is made by appending the source suffix.  A single-suffix
rule whose source suffix is =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 is equivalent=
 to the pattern rule
=E2=80=98<samp>% : %.c</samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Suffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule=E2=80=99s =
target
against a defined list of known suffixes.  When <code>make</code> sees a ru=
le
whose target is a known suffix, this rule is considered a single-suffix
rule.  When <code>make</code> sees a rule whose target is two known suffixe=
s
concatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.
</p>
<p>For example, =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>.o</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 are both on the default list of
known suffixes.  Therefore, if you define a rule whose target is
=E2=80=98<samp>.c.o</samp>=E2=80=99, <code>make</code> takes it to be a dou=
ble-suffix rule with source
suffix =E2=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 and target suffix =E2=80=98<samp>.=
o</samp>=E2=80=99.  Here is the old-fashioned
way to define the rule for compiling a C source file:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.c.o:
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>Suffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own.  If they have a=
ny,
they are treated as normal files with funny names, not as suffix rules.
Thus, the rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.c.o: foo.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>tells how to make the file <samp>.c.o</samp> from the prerequisite file
<samp>foo.h</samp>, and is not at all like the pattern rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">%.o: %.c foo.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>which tells how to make =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 files from =E2=
=80=98<samp>.c</samp>=E2=80=99 files, and makes all
=E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99 files using this pattern rule also depend=
 on <samp>foo.h</samp>.
</p>
<p>Suffix rules with no recipe are also meaningless.  They do not remove
previous rules as do pattern rules with no recipe (see <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Canceling-Rules">Canceling Implic=
it Rules</a>).  They simply enter the suffix or
pair of suffixes concatenated as a target in the data base.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eSUFFIXES-1"></span>
<p>The known suffixes are simply the names of the prerequisites of the spec=
ial
target <code>.SUFFIXES</code>.  You can add your own suffixes by writing a =
rule
for <code>.SUFFIXES</code> that adds more prerequisites, as in:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SUFFIXES: .hack .win
</pre></div>

<p>which adds =E2=80=98<samp>.hack</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>.win<=
/samp>=E2=80=99 to the end of the list of suffixes.
</p>
<p>If you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just addi=
ng
to them, write a rule for <code>.SUFFIXES</code> with no prerequisites.  By
special dispensation, this eliminates all existing prerequisites of
<code>.SUFFIXES</code>.  You can then write another rule to add the suffixe=
s you
want.  For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SUFFIXES:            # <span class=3D"roman">Delete=
 the default suffixes</span>
.SUFFIXES: .c .o .h   # <span class=3D"roman">Define our suffix list</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The =E2=80=98<samp>-r</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--no-builtin-rul=
es</samp>=E2=80=99 flag causes the default
list of suffixes to be empty.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-SUFFIXES"></span>
<p>The variable <code>SUFFIXES</code> is defined to the default list of suf=
fixes
before <code>make</code> reads any makefiles.  You can change the list of s=
uffixes
with a rule for the special target <code>.SUFFIXES</code>, but that does no=
t alter
this variable.

.8 Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</h3>
<span id=3D"index-implicit-rule_002c-search-algorithm"></span>
<span id=3D"index-search-algorithm_002c-implicit-rule"></span>

<p>Here is the procedure <code>make</code> uses for searching for an implic=
it rule
for a target <var>t</var>.  This procedure is followed for each double-colo=
n
rule with no recipe, for each target of ordinary rules none of which have
a recipe, and for each prerequisite that is not the target of any rule.  It
is also followed recursively for prerequisites that come from implicit
rules, in the search for a chain of rules.
</p>
<p>Suffix rules are not mentioned in this algorithm because suffix rules ar=
e
converted to equivalent pattern rules once the makefiles have been read in.
</p>
<p>For an archive member target of the form
=E2=80=98<samp><var>archive</var>(<var>member</var>)</samp>=E2=80=99, the f=
ollowing algorithm is run
twice, first using the entire target name <var>t</var>, and second using
=E2=80=98<samp>(<var>member</var>)</samp>=E2=80=99 as the target <var>t</va=
r> if the first run found no
rule.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Split <var>t</var> into a directory part, called <var>d</var>, and the=
 rest,
called <var>n</var>.  For example, if <var>t</var> is =E2=80=98<samp>src/fo=
o.o</samp>=E2=80=99, then
<var>d</var> is =E2=80=98<samp>src/</samp>=E2=80=99 and <var>n</var> is =E2=
=80=98<samp>foo.o</samp>=E2=80=99.

</li><li> Make a list of all the pattern rules one of whose targets matches
<var>t</var> or <var>n</var>.  If the target pattern contains a slash, it i=
s
matched against <var>t</var>; otherwise, against <var>n</var>.

</li><li> If any rule in that list is <em>not</em> a match-anything rule, o=
r if
<var>t</var> is a prerequisite of an implicit rule, then remove all
non-terminal match-anything rules from the list.

</li><li> Remove from the list all rules with no recipe.

</li><li> For each pattern rule in the list:

<ol type=3D"a" start=3D"1">
<li> Find the stem <var>s</var>, which is the nonempty part of <var>t</var>=
 or <var>n</var>
matched by the =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in the target pattern.

</li><li> Compute the prerequisite names by substituting <var>s</var> for =
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99; if
the target pattern does not contain a slash, append <var>d</var> to
the front of each prerequisite name.

</li><li> Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.  (If =
a
file name is mentioned in the makefile as a target or as an explicit
prerequisite of target T, then we say it ought to exist.)

<p>If all prerequisites exist or ought to exist, or there are no prerequisi=
tes,
then this rule applies.
</p></li></ol>

</li><li> If no pattern rule has been found so far, try harder.
For each pattern rule in the list:

<ol type=3D"a" start=3D"1">
<li> If the rule is terminal, ignore it and go on to the next rule.

</li><li> Compute the prerequisite names as before.

</li><li> Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.

</li><li> For each prerequisite that does not exist, follow this algorithm
recursively to see if the prerequisite can be made by an implicit
rule.

</li><li> If all prerequisites exist, ought to exist, or can be
made by implicit rules, then this rule applies.
</li></ol>

</li><li> If no pattern rule has been found then try step 5 and step 6 agai=
n with a
modified definition of =E2=80=9Cought to exist=E2=80=9D: if a filename is m=
entioned as a
target or as an explicit prerequisite of <em>any</em> target, then it ought=
 to
exist.  This check is only present for backward-compatibility with older
versions of GNU Make: we don=E2=80=99t recommend relying on it.

</li><li> If no implicit rule applies, the rule for <code>.DEFAULT</code>, =
if any,
applies.  In that case, give <var>t</var> the same recipe that
<code>.DEFAULT</code> has.  Otherwise, there is no recipe for <var>t</var>.
</li></ol>

<p>Once a rule that applies has been found, for each target pattern of
the rule other than the one that matched <var>t</var> or <var>n</var>, the
=E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99 in the pattern is replaced with <var>s</va=
r> and the resultant
file name is stored until the recipe to remake the target file <var>t</var>
is executed.  After the recipe is executed, each of these stored file
names are entered into the data base and marked as having been updated
and having the same update status as the file <var>t</var>.
</p>
<p>When the recipe of a pattern rule is executed for <var>t</var>, the
automatic variables are set corresponding to the target and
prerequisites.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/mak=
e.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.

<span id=3D"Archive-Members-as-Targets"></span><h3 class=3D"section">11.1 A=
rchive Members as Targets</h3>
<span id=3D"index-archive-member-targets"></span>

<p>An individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or
prerequisite in <code>make</code>.  You specify the member named <var>membe=
r</var> in
archive file <var>archive</var> as follows:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"><var>archive</var>(<var>member</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>This construct is available only in targets and prerequisites, not in
recipes!  Most programs that you might use in recipes do not support
this syntax and cannot act directly on archive members.  Only
<code>ar</code> and other programs specifically designed to operate on
archives can do so.  Therefore, valid recipes to update an archive
member target probably must use <code>ar</code>.  For example, this rule
says to create a member <samp>hack.o</samp> in archive <samp>foolib</samp> =
by
copying the file <samp>hack.o</samp>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foolib(hack.o) : hack.o
        ar cr foolib hack.o
</pre></div>

<p>In fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this way
and there is an implicit rule to do it for you.  <strong>Please note:</stro=
ng> The
=E2=80=98<samp>c</samp>=E2=80=99 flag to <code>ar</code> is required if the=
 archive file does not
already exist.
</p>
<p>To specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the
member names together between the parentheses.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foolib(hack.o kludge.o)
</pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-wildcard_002c-in-archive-member"></span>
<p>You can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member reference.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcards=
">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</a>.  For
example, =E2=80=98<samp>foolib(*.o)</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> expands to =
all existing members of the
<samp>foolib</samp> archive whose names end in =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=
=80=99; perhaps
=E2=80=98<samp>foolib(hack.o)<!-- /@w --> foolib(kludge.o)<!-- /@w --></sam=
p>=E2=80=99.

<span id=3D"Implicit-Rule-for-Archive-Member-Targets"></span><h3 class=3D"s=
ection">11.2 Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</h3>

<p>Recall that a target that looks like <samp><var>a</var>(<var>m</var>)</s=
amp> stands for the
member named <var>m</var> in the archive file <var>a</var>.
</p>
<p>When <code>make</code> looks for an implicit rule for such a target, as =
a special
feature it considers implicit rules that match <samp>(<var>m</var>)</samp>,=
 as well as
those that match the actual target <samp><var>a</var>(<var>m</var>)</samp>.
</p>
<p>This causes one special rule whose target is <samp>(%)</samp> to match. =
 This
rule updates the target <samp><var>a</var>(<var>m</var>)</samp> by copying =
the file <var>m</var>
into the archive.  For example, it will update the archive member target
<samp>foo.a(bar.o)</samp> by copying the <em>file</em> <samp>bar.o</samp> i=
nto the
archive <samp>foo.a</samp> as a <em>member</em> named <samp>bar.o</samp>.
</p>
<p>When this rule is chained with others, the result is very powerful.
Thus, =E2=80=98<samp>make "foo.a(bar.o)"</samp>=E2=80=99 (the quotes are ne=
eded to protect the
=E2=80=98<samp>(</samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>)</samp>=E2=80=99 from =
being interpreted specially by the shell) in
the presence of a file <samp>bar.c</samp> is enough to cause the following
recipe to be run, even without a makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">cc -c bar.c -o bar.o
ar r foo.a bar.o
rm -f bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>Here <code>make</code> has envisioned the file <samp>bar.o</samp> as an =
intermediate
file.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Ch=
ained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>Implicit rules such as this one are written using the automatic variable
=E2=80=98<samp>$%</samp>=E2=80=99.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/soft=
ware/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>An archive member name in an archive cannot contain a directory name, bu=
t
it may be useful in a makefile to pretend that it does.  If you write an
archive member target <samp>foo.a(dir/file.o)</samp>, <code>make</code> wil=
l perform
automatic updating with this recipe:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ar r foo.a dir/file.o
</pre></div>

<p>which has the effect of copying the file <samp>dir/file.o</samp> into a =
member
named <samp>file.o</samp>.  In connection with such usage, the automatic va=
riables
<code>%D</code> and <code>%F</code> may be useful.

<p>An archive file that is used as a library usually contains a special mem=
ber
named <samp>__.SYMDEF</samp> that contains a directory of the external symb=
ol
names defined by all the other members.  After you update any other
members, you need to update <samp>__.SYMDEF</samp> so that it will summariz=
e the
other members properly.  This is done by running the <code>ranlib</code> pr=
ogram:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ranlib <var>archivefile</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Normally you would put this command in the rule for the archive file,
and make all the members of the archive file prerequisites of that rule.
For example,
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">libfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o y.o =E2=80=A6)
        ranlib libfoo.a
</pre></div>

<p>The effect of this is to update archive members <samp>x.o</samp>, <samp>=
y.o</samp>,
etc., and then update the symbol directory member <samp>__.SYMDEF</samp> by
running <code>ranlib</code>.  The rules for updating the members are not sh=
own
here; most likely you can omit them and use the implicit rule which copies
files into the archive, as described in the preceding section.
</p>
<p>This is not necessary when using the GNU <code>ar</code> program, which
updates the <samp>__.SYMDEF</samp> member automatically.

<p>The built-in rules for updating archives are incompatible with parallel
builds.  These rules (required by the POSIX standard) add each object file
into the archive as it=E2=80=99s compiled.  When parallel builds are enable=
d this
allows multiple <code>ar</code> commands to be updating the same archive
simultaneously, which is not supported.
</p>
<p>If you want to use parallel builds with archives you can override the de=
fault
rules by adding these lines to your makefile:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">(%) : % ;
%.a : ; $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $@ $?
</pre></div>

<p>The first line changes the rule that updates an individual object in the
archive to do nothing, and the second line changes the default rule for
building an archive to update all the outdated objects (<code>$?</code>) in=
 one
command.
</p>
<p>Of course you will still need to declare the prerequisites of your libra=
ry
using the archive syntax:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">libfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o y.o =E2=80=A6)
</pre></div>

<p>If you prefer to write an explicit rule you can use:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">libfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o y.o =E2=80=A6)
        $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $@ $?
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-_002ea-_0028archives_0029"></span>

<p>You can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive
files.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#S=
uffix-Rules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>, for a full explanation of suff=
ix rules.
Archive suffix rules are obsolete in GNU <code>make</code>, because pattern
rules for archives are a more general mechanism (see <a href=3D"https://www=
.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archive-Update">Implicit Rule for A=
rchive Member Targets</a>).  But they are retained for compatibility with o=
ther
<code>make</code>s.
</p>
<p>To write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule
using the target suffix =E2=80=98<samp>.a</samp>=E2=80=99 (the usual suffix=
 for archive files).
For example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to update a library
archive from C source files:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.c.a:
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</pre></div>

<p>This works just as if you had written the pattern rule:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">(%.o): %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</pre></div>

<p>In fact, this is just what <code>make</code> does when it sees a suffix =
rule
with =E2=80=98<samp>.a</samp>=E2=80=99 as the target suffix.  Any double-su=
ffix rule
=E2=80=98<samp>.<var>x</var>.a</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> is converted to =
a pattern rule with the target
pattern =E2=80=98<samp>(%.o)</samp>=E2=80=99 and a prerequisite pattern of =
=E2=80=98<samp>%.<var>x</var></samp>=E2=80=99.
</p>
<p>Since you might want to use =E2=80=98<samp>.a</samp>=E2=80=99 as the suf=
fix for some other kind
of file, <code>make</code> also converts archive suffix rules to pattern ru=
les
in the normal way (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/=
make.html#Suffix-Rules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>).  Thus a double-suf=
fix rule
=E2=80=98<samp>.<var>x</var>.a</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> produces two pat=
tern rules: =E2=80=98<samp>(%.o):<!-- /@w -->
%.<var>x</var><!-- /@w --></samp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>%.a<!-- /@w -=
->: %.<var>x</var><!-- /@w --></samp>=E2=80=99.

<span id=3D"index-make-extensions"></span>

<p>GNU <code>make</code> provides many advanced capabilities, including man=
y
useful functions.  However, it does not contain a complete programming
language and so it has limitations.  Sometimes these limitations can be
overcome through use of the <code>shell</code> function to invoke a separat=
e
program, although this can be inefficient.
</p>
<p>In cases where the built-in capabilities of GNU <code>make</code> are
insufficient to your requirements there are two options for extending
<code>make</code>.  On systems where it=E2=80=99s provided, you can utilize=
 GNU
Guile as an embedded scripting language (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org=
/software/make/manual/make.html#Guile-Integration">GNU
Guile Integration</a>).  On systems which support dynamically loadable
objects, you can write your own extension in any language (which can
be compiled into such an object) and load it to provide extended
capabilities (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.=

<p>GNU <code>make</code> may be built with support for GNU Guile as an embe=
dded
extension language.  Guile implements the Scheme language.  A review
of GNU Guile and the Scheme language and its features is beyond the
scope of this manual: see the documentation for GNU Guile and Scheme.
</p>
<p>You can determine if <code>make</code> contains support for Guile by
examining the <code>.FEATURES</code> variable; it will contain the word
<var>guile</var> if Guile support is available.
</p>
<p>The Guile integration provides one new <code>make</code> function: <code=
>guile</code>.
The <code>guile</code> function takes one argument which is first expanded
by <code>make</code> in the normal fashion, then passed to the GNU Guile
evaluator.  The result of the evaluator is converted into a string and
used as the expansion of the <code>guile</code> function in the makefile.
</p>
<p>In addition, GNU <code>make</code> exposes Guile procedures for use in G=
uile
scripts.

<span id=3D"index-guile_002c-conversion-of-types"></span>
<span id=3D"index-types_002c-conversion-of"></span>

<p>There is only one =E2=80=9Cdata type=E2=80=9D in <code>make</code>: a st=
ring.  GNU Guile,
on the other hand, provides a rich variety of different data types.
An important aspect of the interface between <code>make</code> and GNU Guil=
e
is the conversion of Guile data types into <code>make</code> strings.
</p>
<p>This conversion is relevant in two places: when a makefile invokes the
<code>guile</code> function to evaluate a Guile expression, the result of
that evaluation must be converted into a make string so it can be
further evaluated by <code>make</code>.  And secondly, when a Guile script
invokes one of the procedures exported by <code>make</code> the argument
provided to the procedure must be converted into a string.
</p>
<p>The conversion of Guile types into <code>make</code> strings is as below=
:
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt><span><code>#f</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>False is converted into the empty string: in <code>make</code> condi=
tionals
the empty string is considered false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>#t</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>True is converted to the string =E2=80=98<samp>#t</samp>=E2=80=99: i=
n <code>make</code> conditionals
any non-empty string is considered true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>symbol</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>number</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>A symbol or number is converted into the string representation of th=
at
symbol or number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>character</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>A printable character is converted to the same character.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>string</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>A string containing only printable characters is converted to the sa=
me
string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>list</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>A list is converted recursively according to the above rules.  This
implies that any structured list will be flattened (that is, a result
of =E2=80=98<samp>'(a b (c d) e)</samp>=E2=80=99 will be converted to the <=
code>make</code> string
=E2=80=98<samp>a b c d e</samp>=E2=80=99).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>other</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Any other Guile type results in an error.  In future versions of
<code>make</code>, other Guile types may be converted.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The translation of =E2=80=98<samp>#f</samp>=E2=80=99 (to the empty strin=
g) and =E2=80=98<samp>#t</samp>=E2=80=99 (to
the non-empty string =E2=80=98<samp>#t</samp>=E2=80=99) is designed to allo=
w you to use Guile
boolean results directly as <code>make</code> boolean conditions.  For
example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(if $(guile (access? "myfile" R_OK)),$(info myfile =
exists))
</pre></div>

<p>As a consequence of these conversion rules you must consider the
result of your Guile script, as that result will be converted into a
string and parsed by <code>make</code>.  If there is no natural result for
the script (that is, the script exists solely for its side-effects),
you should add =E2=80=98<samp>#f</samp>=E2=80=99 as the final expression in=
 order to avoid
syntax errors in your makefile.

<p>In addition to the <code>guile</code> function available in makefiles,
<code>make</code> exposes some procedures for use in your Guile scripts.  A=
t
startup <code>make</code> creates a new Guile module, <code>gnu make</code>=
, and
exports these procedures as public interfaces from that module:

<dl compact=3D"compact">

<dd><p>This procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a

</p>

<dd><p>This procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a
string.  The string is evaluated by <code>make</code> as if it were a
makefile.  This is the same capability available via the <code>eval</code>
function (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=
#Eval-Function">The <code>eval</code> Function</a>).  The result of the <co=

</p>
<p>Note that <code>gmk-eval</code> is not quite the same as using
<code>gmk-expand</code> with the <code>eval</code> function: in the latter =

the evaluated string will be expanded <em>twice</em>; first by

.1.3 Example Using Guile in <code>make</code></h4>
<span id=3D"index-Guile-example"></span>
<span id=3D"index-example-using-Guile"></span>

<p>Here is a very simple example using GNU Guile to manage writing to a
file.  These Guile procedures simply open a file, allow writing to the
file (one string per line), and close the file.  Note that because we
cannot store complex values such as Guile ports in <code>make</code>
variables, we=E2=80=99ll keep the port as a global variable in the Guile
interpreter.
</p>
<p>You can create Guile functions easily using <code>define</code>/<code>en=
def</code>
to create a Guile script, then use the <code>guile</code> function to
internalize it:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">define GUILEIO
;; A simple Guile IO library for GNU Make

(define MKPORT #f)

(define (mkopen name mode)
  (set! MKPORT (open-file name mode))
  #f)

(define (mkwrite s)
  (display s MKPORT)
  (newline MKPORT)
  #f)

(define (mkclose)
  (close-port MKPORT)
  #f)

#f
endef

# Internalize the Guile IO functions
$(guile $(GUILEIO))
</pre></div>

<p>If you have a significant amount of Guile support code, you might
consider keeping it in a different file (e.g., <samp>guileio.scm</samp>) an=
d
then loading it in your makefile using the <code>guile</code> function:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(guile (load "guileio.scm"))
</pre></div>

<p>An advantage to this method is that when editing <samp>guileio.scm</samp=
>,
your editor will understand that this file contains Scheme syntax
rather than makefile syntax.
</p>
<p>Now you can use these Guile functions to create files.  Suppose you
need to operate on a very large list, which cannot fit on the command
line, but the utility you=E2=80=99re using accepts the list as input as wel=
l:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">prog: $(PREREQS)
        @$(guile (mkopen "tmp.out" "w")) \
         $(foreach X,$^,$(guile (mkwrite "$(X)"))) \
         $(guile (mkclose))
        $(LINK) &lt; tmp.out
</pre></div>

<p>A more comprehensive suite of file manipulation procedures is possible
of course.  You could, for example, maintain multiple output files at
the same time by choosing a symbol for each one and using it as the
key to a hash table, where the value is a port, then returning the
symbol to be stored in a <code>make</code> variable.

<p>Many operating systems provide a facility for dynamically loading
compiled objects.  If your system provides this facility, GNU
<code>make</code> can make use of it to load dynamic objects at runtime,
providing new capabilities which may then be invoked by your makefile.
</p>
<p>The <code>load</code> directive is used to load a dynamic object.  Once =
the
object is loaded, a =E2=80=9Csetup=E2=80=9D function will be invoked to all=
ow the
object to initialize itself and register new facilities with GNU
<code>make</code>.  A dynamic object might include new <code>make</code> fu=
nctions,
for example, and the =E2=80=9Csetup=E2=80=9D function would register them w=
ith GNU
<code>make</code>=E2=80=99s function handling system.

<code>load</code> Directive</h4>
<span id=3D"index-load-directive"></span>
<span id=3D"index-extensions_002c-load-directive"></span>

<p>Objects are loaded into GNU <code>make</code> by placing the <code>load<=
/code>
directive into your makefile.  The syntax of the <code>load</code> directiv=
e
is as follows:
</p>
<span id=3D"index-load"></span>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">load <var>object-file</var> =E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p>or:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">load <var>object-file</var>(<var>symbol-name</var>) =
=E2=80=A6
</pre></div>

<p>The file <var>object-file</var> is dynamically loaded by GNU <code>make<=
/code>.
If <var>object-file</var> does not include a directory path then it is
first looked for in the current directory.  If it is not found there,
or a directory path is included, then system-specific paths will be
searched.  If the load fails for any reason, <code>make</code> will print a
message and exit.
</p>
<p>If the load succeeds <code>make</code> will invoke an initializing funct=
ion.
</p>
<p>If <var>symbol-name</var> is provided, it will be used as the name of th=
e
initializing function.
</p>
<p>If no <var>symbol-name</var> is provided, the initializing function name=
 is
created by taking the base file name of <var>object-file</var>, up to the
first character which is not a valid symbol name character
(alphanumerics and underscores are valid symbol name characters).  To
this prefix will be appended the suffix <code>_gmk_setup</code>.
</p>
<p>More than one object file may be loaded with a single <code>load</code>
directive, and both forms of <code>load</code> arguments may be used in the
same directive.
</p>
<p>The initializing function will be provided the file name and line
number of the invocation of the <code>load</code> operation.  It should
return a value of type <code>int</code>, which must be <code>0</code> on fa=
ilure
and non-<code>0</code> on success.  If the return value is <code>-1</code>,=
 then
GNU Make will <em>not</em> attempt to rebuild the object file
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking=
-Loaded-Objects">How Loaded Objects Are Remade</a>).
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">load ../mk_funcs.so
</pre></div>

<p>will load the dynamic object <samp>../mk_funcs.so</samp>.  After the obj=
ect
is loaded, <code>make</code> will invoke the function (assumed to be define=
d
by the shared object) <code>mk_funcs_gmk_setup</code>.
</p>
<p>On the other hand:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">load ../mk_funcs.so(init_mk_func)
</pre></div>

<p>will load the dynamic object <samp>../mk_funcs.so</samp>.  After the obj=
ect
is loaded, <code>make</code> will invoke the function <code>init_mk_func</c=
ode>.
</p>
<p>Regardless of how many times an object file appears in a <code>load</cod=
e>
directive, it will only be loaded (and its setup function will only
be invoked) once.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002eLOADED"></span>
<p>After an object has been successfully loaded, its file name is
appended to the <code>.LOADED</code> variable.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002dload"></span>
<p>If you would prefer that failure to load a dynamic object not be
reported as an error, you can use the <code>-load</code> directive instead
of <code>load</code>.  GNU <code>make</code> will not fail and no message w=
ill be
generated if an object fails to load.  The failed object is not added
to the <code>.LOADED</code> variable, which can then be consulted to
determine if the load was successful.

<table class=3D"cartouche" border=3D"1"><tbody><tr><td>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Warning:</b> For this feature to be useful your extensions will need =
to invoke
various functions internal to GNU <code>make</code>.  The programming
interfaces provided in this release should not be considered stable:
functions may be added, removed, or change calling signatures or
implementations in future versions of GNU <code>make</code>.
</p></blockquote>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>To be useful, loaded objects must be able to interact with GNU
<code>make</code>.  This interaction includes both interfaces the loaded
object provides to makefiles and also interfaces <code>make</code> provides
to the loaded object to manipulate <code>make</code>=E2=80=99s operation.
</p>
<p>The interface between loaded objects and <code>make</code> is defined by=
 the
<samp>gnumake.h</samp> C header file.  All loaded objects written in C
should include this header file.  Any loaded object not written in C
will need to implement the interface defined in this header file.
</p>
<p>Typically, a loaded object will register one or more new GNU
<code>make</code> functions using the <code>gmk_add_function</code> routine=
 from
within its setup function.  The implementations of these <code>make</code>
functions may make use of the <code>gmk_expand</code> and <code>gmk_eval</c=
ode>
routines to perform their tasks, then optionally return a string as
the result of the function expansion.

<p>Every dynamic extension should define the global symbol
<code>plugin_is_GPL_compatible</code> to assert that it has been licensed
under a GPL-compatible license.  If this symbol does not exist,
<code>make</code> emits a fatal error and exits when it tries to load your
extension.
</p>
<p>The declared type of the symbol should be <code>int</code>. It does not =
need
to be in any allocated section, though.  The code merely asserts that
the symbol exists in the global scope. Something like this is enough:

which may then be invoked from within the makefile in the same way as
any other function.
</p>
<p>Use <code>gmk_add_function</code> to create a new <code>make</code> func=

<p>A function registered with <code>make</code> must match the
<code>gmk_func_ptr</code> type.  It will be invoked with three parameters:
<code>name</code> (the name of the function), <code>argc</code> (the number=
 of
arguments to the function), and <code>argv</code> (an array of pointers to
arguments to the function).  The last pointer (that is,
<code>argv[argc]</code>) will be null (<code>0</code>).
</p>
<p>The return value of the function is the result of expanding the
function.  If the function expands to nothing the return value may be
null.  Otherwise, it must be a pointer to a string created with
<code>gmk_alloc</code>.  Once the function returns, <code>make</code> owns =
this
string and will free it when appropriate; it cannot be accessed by the
loaded object.
</p>
<span id=3D"GNU-make-Facilities"></span><h4 class=3D"subsubheading">GNU <co=

<p>There are some facilities exported by GNU <code>make</code> for use by
loaded objects.  Typically these would be run from within the
setup function and/or the functions registered via
<code>gmk_add_function</code>, to retrieve or modify the data <code>make</c=

works with.

<p>Note that there is a difference between <code>gmk_eval</code> and callin=

 in
the latter case the string will be expanded <em>twice</em>; once by

<span id=3D"Memory-Management"></span><h4 class=3D"subsubheading">Memory Ma=

</p>
<p>In particular, the string returned to <code>make</code> by a function

<p>Let=E2=80=99s suppose we wanted to write a new GNU <code>make</code> fun=
ction that
would create a temporary file and return its name.  We would like our
function to take a prefix as an argument.  First we can write the
function in a file <samp>mk_temp.c</samp>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;

#include &lt;gnumake.h&gt;

int plugin_is_GPL_compatible;

char *
gen_tmpfile(const char *nm, int argc, char **argv)
{
  int fd;

  /* Compute the size of the filename and allocate space for it.  */
  int len =3D strlen (argv[0]) + 6 + 1;
  char *buf =3D gmk_alloc (len);

  strcpy (buf, argv[0]);
  strcat (buf, "XXXXXX");

  fd =3D mkstemp(buf);
  if (fd &gt;=3D 0)
    {
      /* Don't leak the file descriptor.  */
      close (fd);
      return buf;
    }

  /* Failure.  */
  fprintf (stderr, "mkstemp(%s) failed: %s\n", buf, strerror (errno));
  gmk_free (buf);
  return NULL;
}

int
mk_temp_gmk_setup (const gmk_floc *floc)
{
  printf ("mk_temp plugin loaded from %s:%lu\n", floc-&gt;filenm, floc-&gt;=
lineno);
  /* Register the function with make name "mk-temp".  */
  gmk_add_function ("mk-temp", gen_tmpfile, 1, 1, 1);
  return 1;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Next, we will write a <samp>Makefile</samp> that can build this shared o=
bject, load
it, and use it:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">all:
        @echo Temporary file: $(mk-temp tmpfile.)

load mk_temp.so

mk_temp.so: mk_temp.c
        $(CC) -shared -fPIC -o $@ $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>On MS-Windows, due to peculiarities of how shared objects are
produced, the compiler needs to scan the <em>import library</em> produced
when building <code>make</code>, typically called
<samp>libgnumake-<var>version</var>.dll.a</samp>, where <var>version</var> =
is the
version of the load object API.  So the recipe to produce a shared
object will look on Windows like this (assuming the API version is 1):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">mk_temp.dll: mk_temp.c
        $(CC) -shared -o $@ $&lt; -lgnumake-1
</pre></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>make</code> you=E2=80=99ll see something like:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$ make
mk_temp plugin loaded from Makefile:4
cc -shared -fPIC -o mk_temp.so mk_temp.c
Temporary filename: tmpfile.A7JEwd

<span id=3D"index-make-integration"></span>

<p>GNU <code>make</code> is often one component in a larger system of tools=
,
including integrated development environments, compiler toolchains,
and others.  The role of <code>make</code> is to start commands and
determine whether they succeeded or not: no special integration is
needed to accomplish that.  However, sometimes it is convenient to
bind <code>make</code> more tightly with other parts of the system, both
higher-level (tools that invoke <code>make</code>) and lower-level (tools
that <code>make</code> invokes).

3.1 Sharing Job Slots with GNU <code>make</code></h3>
<span id=3D"index-job-slots_002c-sharing"></span>
<span id=3D"index-tools_002c-sharing-job-slots"></span>

<p>GNU <code>make</code> has the ability to run multiple recipes in paralle=
l
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel=
">Parallel Execution</a>) and to cap the total number of
parallel jobs even across recursive invocations of <code>make</code>
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_=
002fRecursion">Communicating Options to a
Sub-<code>make</code></a>).  Tools that <code>make</code> invokes which are=
 also able
to run multiple operations in parallel, either using multiple threads
or multiple processes, can be enhanced to participate in GNU
<code>make</code>=E2=80=99s job management facility to ensure that the tota=
l number
of active threads/processes running on the system does not exceed the
maximum number of slots provided to GNU <code>make</code>.=20
</p>
<span id=3D"index-jobserver"></span>
<p>GNU <code>make</code> uses a method called the =E2=80=9Cjobserver=E2=80=
=9D to control the
number of active jobs across recursive invocations.  The actual
implementation of the jobserver varies across different operating
systems, but some fundamental aspects are always true.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002djobserver_002dauth"></span>
<p>First, <code>make</code> will provide information necessary for accessin=
g the
jobserver through the environment to its children, in the <code>MAKEFLAGS</=
code>
environment variable.  Tools which want to participate in the jobserver
protocol will need to parse this environment variable and find the word
starting with <code>--jobserver-auth=3D</code>.  The value of this option w=
ill
describe how to communicate with the jobserver.  The interpretation of this
value is described in the sections below.
</p>
<p>Be aware that the <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> variable may contain multiple i=
nstances of
the <code>--jobserver-auth=3D</code> option.  Only the <em>last</em> instan=
ce is
relevant.
</p>
<p>Second, every command <code>make</code> starts has one implicit job slot
reserved for it before it starts.  Any tool which wants to participate
in the jobserver protocol should assume it can always run one job
without having to contact the jobserver at all.
</p>
<p>Finally, it=E2=80=99s critical that tools that participate in the jobser=
ver
protocol return the exact number of slots they obtained from the
jobserver back to the jobserver before they exit, even under error
conditions.  Remember that the implicit job slot should <strong>not</strong=
>
be returned to the jobserver!  Returning too few slots means that
those slots will be lost for the rest of the build process; returning
too many slots means that extra slots will be available.  The
top-level <code>make</code> command will print an error message at the end
of the build if it detects an incorrect number of slots available in
the jobserver.
</p>
<p>As an example, suppose you are implementing a linker which provides
for multithreaded operation.  You would like to enhance the linker so
that if it is invoked by GNU <code>make</code> it can participate in the
jobserver protocol to control how many threads are used during link.
First you will need to modify the linker to determine if the
<code>MAKEFLAGS</code> environment variable is set.  Next you will need to
parse the value of that variable to determine if the jobserver is
available, and how to access it.  If it is available then you can
access it to obtain job slots controlling how much parallelism your
tool can use.  Once done your tool must return those job slots back to
the jobserver.

.1.1 POSIX Jobserver Interaction</h4>
<span id=3D"index-jobserver-on-POSIX"></span>

<p>On POSIX systems the jobserver is implemented in one of two ways: on sys=
tems
that support it, GNU <code>make</code> will create a named pipe and use tha=
t for the
jobserver.  In this case the auth option will have the form
<code>--jobserver-auth=3Dfifo:PATH</code> where =E2=80=98<samp>PATH</samp>=
=E2=80=99 is the pathname of the
named pipe.  To access the jobserver you should open the named pipe path an=
d
read/write to it as described below.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002djobserver_002dstyle-1"></span>
<p>If the system doesn=E2=80=99t support named pipes, or if the user provid=
ed the
<code>--jobserver-style</code> option and specified =E2=80=98<samp>pipe</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99, then the jobserver
will be implemented as a simple UNIX pipe.  In this case the auth option wi=
ll
have the form <code>--jobserver-auth=3DR,W</code> where =E2=80=98<samp>R</s=
amp>=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98<samp>W</samp>=E2=80=99 are
non-negative integers representing file descriptors: =E2=80=98<samp>R</samp=
>=E2=80=99 is the read file
descriptor and =E2=80=98<samp>W</samp>=E2=80=99 is the write file descripto=
r.  If either or both of
these file descriptors are negative, it means the jobserver is disabled for
this process.
</p>
<p>When using a simple pipe, only command lines that <code>make</code> unde=
rstands to
be recursive invocations of <code>make</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.g=
nu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKE-Variable">How the
<code>MAKE</code> Variable Works</a>) will have access to the jobserver.  W=
hen writing
makefiles you must be sure to mark the command as recursive (most commonly =
by
prefixing the command line with the <code>+</code> indicator (see <a href=
=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive=
 Use of <code>make</code></a>).  Note that the read side of the jobserver
pipe is set to =E2=80=9Cblocking=E2=80=9D mode.  This should not be changed=
.
</p>
<p>In both implementations of the jobserver, the pipe will be pre-loaded wi=
th one
single-character token for each available job.  To obtain an extra slot you
must read a single character from the jobserver; to release a slot you must
write a single character back into the jobserver.
</p>
<p>It=E2=80=99s important that when you release the job slot, you write bac=
k the same
character you read.  Don=E2=80=99t assume that all tokens are the same char=
acter;
different characters may have different meanings to GNU <code>make</code>. =
 The
order is not important, since <code>make</code> has no idea in what order j=
obs will
complete anyway.
</p>
<p>There are various error conditions you must consider to ensure your
implementation is robust:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If you have a command-line argument controlling the parallel operation=
 of your
tool, consider whether your tool should detect situations where both the
jobserver and the command-line argument are specified, and how it should
react.

</li><li> If your tool does not recognize the format of the <code>--jobserv=
er-auth</code>
string, it should assume the jobserver is using a different style and it
cannot connect.

</li><li> If your tool determines that the <code>--jobserver-auth</code> op=
tion references a
simple pipe but that the file descriptors specified are closed, this means
that the calling <code>make</code> process did not think that your tool was=
 a
recursive <code>make</code> invocation (e.g., the command line was not pref=
ixed with
a <code>+</code> character).  You should notify your users of this situatio=
n.

</li><li> Your tool should be sure to write back the tokens it read, even u=
nder error
conditions.  This includes not only errors in your tool but also outside
influences such as interrupts (<code>SIGINT</code>), etc.  You may want to =
install
signal handlers to manage this write-back.

</li><li> Your tool may also examine the first word of the <code>MAKEFLAGS<=
/code> variable and
look for the character <code>n</code>.  If this character is present then
<code>make</code> was invoked with the =E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=99 op=
tion and your tool may want to
stop without performing any operations.
</li></ul>

13.1.2 Windows Jobserver Interaction</h4>
<span id=3D"index-jobserver-on-Windows"></span>

<p>On Windows systems the jobserver is implemented as a named semaphore.
The semaphore will be set with an initial count equal to the number of
available slots; to obtain a slot you must wait on the semaphore (with
or without a timeout).  To release a slot, release the semaphore.
</p>
<p>To access the semaphore you must parse the <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> variab=
le and
look for the argument string <code>--jobserver-auth=3DNAME</code> where
=E2=80=98<samp>NAME</samp>=E2=80=99 is the name of the named semaphore.  Us=
e this name with
<code>OpenSemaphore</code> to create a handle to the semaphore.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-_002d_002djobserver_002dstyle-for-Windows"></span>
<p>The only valid style for <code>--jobserver-style</code> is =E2=80=98<sam=

</p>
<p>There are various error conditions you must consider to ensure your

 Synchronized Terminal Output</h3>
<span id=3D"index-parallel-output-to-terminal"></span>
<span id=3D"index-terminal_002c-output-to"></span>

<p>Normally GNU <code>make</code> will invoke all commands with access to t=
he
same standard and error outputs that <code>make</code> itself was started
with.  A number of tools will detect whether the output is a terminal
or not-a-terminal, and use this information to change the output
style.  For example if the output goes to a terminal the tool may add
control characters that set color, or even change the location of the
cursor.  If the output is not going to a terminal then these special
control characters are not emitted so that they don=E2=80=99t corrupt log
files, etc.
</p>
<p>The <code>--output-sync</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softw=
are/make/manual/make.html#Parallel-Output">Output During
Parallel Execution</a>) option will defeat the terminal detection.  When
output synchronization is enabled GNU <code>make</code> arranges for all
command output to be written to a file, so that its output can be
written as a block without interference from other commands.  This
means that all tools invoked by <code>make</code> will believe that their
output is not going to be displayed on a terminal, even when it will
be (because <code>make</code> will display it there after the command is
completed).
</p>
<p>In order to facilitate tools which would like to determine whether or
not their output will be displayed on a terminal, GNU <code>make</code> wil=
l
set the <code>MAKE_TERMOUT</code> and <code>MAKE_TERMERR</code> environment
variables before invoking any commands.  Tools which would like to
determine whether standard or error output (respectively) will be
displayed on a terminal can check these environment variables to
determine if they exist and contain a non-empty value.  If so the tool
can assume that the output will (eventually) be displayed on a
terminal.  If the variables are not set or have an empty value, then
the tool should fall back to its normal methods of detecting whether
output is going to a terminal or not.
</p>
<p>The content of the variables can be parsed to determine the type of
terminal which will be used to display the output.
</p>
<p>Similarly, environments which invoke <code>make</code> and would like to
capture the output and eventually display it on a terminal (or some
display which can interpret terminal control characters) can set these
variables before invoking <code>make</code>.  GNU <code>make</code> will no=
t
modify these environment variables if they already exist when it
starts.

of GNU <code>make</code></h2>
<span id=3D"index-features-of-GNU-make"></span>
<span id=3D"index-portability"></span>
<span id=3D"index-compatibility"></span>

<p>Here is a summary of the features of GNU <code>make</code>, for comparis=
on
with and credit to other versions of <code>make</code>.  We consider the
features of <code>make</code> in 4.2 BSD systems as a baseline.  If you are
concerned with writing portable makefiles, you should not use the
features of <code>make</code> listed here, nor the ones in <a href=3D"https=
://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Missing">Incompatibilities an=
d Missing Features</a>.
</p>
<p>Many features come from the version of <code>make</code> in System V.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <code>VPATH</code> variable and its special meaning.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory=
-Search">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</a>.
This feature exists in System V <code>make</code>, but is undocumented.
It is documented in 4.3 BSD <code>make</code> (which says it mimics System =
V=E2=80=99s
<code>VPATH</code> feature).

</li><li> Included makefiles.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/=
make/manual/make.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>.
Allowing multiple files to be included with a single directive is a GNU
extension.

</li><li> Variables are read from and communicated via the environment.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Environme=
nt">Variables from the Environment</a>.

</li><li> Options passed through the variable <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> to rec=
ursive
invocations of <code>make</code>.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_0=
02fRecursion">Communicating Options to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>.

</li><li> The automatic variable <code>$%</code> is set to the member name
in an archive reference.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/=
manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.

</li><li> The automatic variables <code>$@</code>, <code>$*</code>, <code>$=
&lt;</code>, <code>$%</code>,
and <code>$?</code> have corresponding forms like <code>$(@F)</code> and
<code>$(@D)</code>.  We have generalized this to <code>$^</code> as an obvi=
ous
extension.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.ht=
ml#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.

</li><li> Substitution variable references.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Reference=
">Basics of Variable References</a>.

</li><li> The command line options =E2=80=98<samp>-b</samp>=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98<samp>-m</samp>=E2=80=99, accepted and
ignored.  In System V <code>make</code>, these options actually do somethin=
g.

</li><li> Execution of recursive commands to run <code>make</code> via the =
variable
<code>MAKE</code> even if =E2=80=98<samp>-n</samp>=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98<samp=
>-q</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>-t</samp>=E2=80=99 is specified.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion=
">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>.

</li><li> Support for suffix =E2=80=98<samp>.a</samp>=E2=80=99 in suffix ru=
les.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Arc=
hive-Suffix-Rules">Suffix Rules for Archive Files</a>.  This feature is obs=
olete in GNU <code>make</code>, because the
general feature of rule chaining (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwa=
re/make/manual/make.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of
Implicit Rules</a>) allows one pattern rule for installing members in an
archive (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#=
Archive-Update">Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</a>) to be suffici=
ent.

</li><li> The arrangement of lines and backslash/newline combinations in
recipes is retained when the recipes are printed, so they appear as
they do in the makefile, except for the stripping of initial
whitespace.
</li></ul>

<p>The following features were inspired by various other versions of
<code>make</code>.  In some cases it is unclear exactly which versions insp=
ired
which others.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Pattern rules using =E2=80=98<samp>%</samp>=E2=80=99.
This has been implemented in several versions of <code>make</code>.
We=E2=80=99re not sure who invented it first, but it=E2=80=99s been spread =
around a bit.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-R=
ules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>.

</li><li> Rule chaining and implicit intermediate files.
This was implemented by Stu Feldman in his version of <code>make</code>
for AT&amp;T Eighth Edition Research Unix, and later by Andrew Hume of
AT&amp;T Bell Labs in his <code>mk</code> program (where he terms it
=E2=80=9Ctransitive closure=E2=80=9D).  We do not really know if
we got this from either of them or thought it up ourselves at the
same time.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.ht=
ml#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.

</li><li> The automatic variable <code>$^</code> containing a list of all p=
rerequisites
of the current target.  We did not invent this, but we have no idea who
did.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Aut=
omatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.  The automatic variable
<code>$+</code> is a simple extension of <code>$^</code>.

</li><li> The =E2=80=9Cwhat if=E2=80=9D flag (=E2=80=98<samp>-W</samp>=E2=
=80=99 in GNU <code>make</code>) was (as far as we know)
invented by Andrew Hume in <code>mk</code>.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-o=
f-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>.

</li><li> The concept of doing several things at once (parallelism) exists =
in
many incarnations of <code>make</code> and similar programs, though not in =
the
System V or BSD implementations.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwa=
re/make/manual/make.html#Execution">Recipe Execution</a>.

</li><li> A number of different build tools that support parallelism also
support collecting output and displaying as a single block.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel-=
Output">Output During Parallel Execution</a>.

</li><li> Modified variable references using pattern substitution come from
SunOS 4.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html=
#Reference">Basics of Variable References</a>.
This functionality was provided in GNU <code>make</code> by the
<code>patsubst</code> function before the alternate syntax was implemented
for compatibility with SunOS 4.  It is not altogether clear who
inspired whom, since GNU <code>make</code> had <code>patsubst</code> before=
 SunOS
4 was released.

</li><li> The special significance of =E2=80=98<samp>+</samp>=E2=80=99 char=
acters preceding recipe lines
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-=
of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>) is
mandated by <cite>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</cite> (POSIX.2).

</li><li> The =E2=80=98<samp>+=3D</samp>=E2=80=99 syntax to append to the v=
alue of a variable comes from SunOS
4 <code>make</code>.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manu=
al/make.html#Appending">Appending More Text to Variables</a>.

</li><li> The syntax =E2=80=98<samp><var>archive</var>(<var>mem1</var>&nbsp=
;<var>mem2</var>=E2=80=A6)</samp>=E2=80=99<!-- /@w --> to list
multiple members in a single archive file comes from SunOS 4 <code>make</co=
de>.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archive-M=
embers">Archive Members as Targets</a>.

</li><li> The <code>-include</code> directive to include makefiles with no =
error for a
nonexistent file comes from SunOS 4 <code>make</code>.  (But note that SunO=
S 4
<code>make</code> does not allow multiple makefiles to be specified in one
<code>-include</code> directive.)  The same feature appears with the name
<code>sinclude</code> in SGI <code>make</code> and perhaps others.

</li><li> The <code>!=3D</code> shell assignment operator exists in many BS=
D of
<code>make</code> and is purposefully implemented here to behave identicall=
y
to those implementations.

</li><li> Various build management tools are implemented using scripting
languages such as Perl or Python and thus provide a natural embedded
scripting language, similar to GNU <code>make</code>=E2=80=99s integration =
of GNU
Guile.
</li></ul>

<p>The remaining features are inventions new in GNU <code>make</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Use the =E2=80=98<samp>-v</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--version<=
/samp>=E2=80=99 option to print version and
copyright information.

</li><li> Use the =E2=80=98<samp>-h</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--hel=
p</samp>=E2=80=99 option to summarize the options to
<code>make</code>.

</li><li> Simply-expanded variables.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/so=
ftware/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</a>.

</li><li> Pass command line variable assignments automatically through the
variable <code>MAKE</code> to recursive <code>make</code> invocations.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion=
">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>.

</li><li> Use the =E2=80=98<samp>-C</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--dir=
ectory</samp>=E2=80=99 command option to change
directory.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.ht=
ml#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>.

</li><li> Make verbatim variable definitions with <code>define</code>.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multi_002=
dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>.

</li><li> Declare phony targets with the special target <code>.PHONY</code>=
.

<p>Andrew Hume of AT&amp;T Bell Labs implemented a similar feature with a
different syntax in his <code>mk</code> program.  This seems to be a case o=
f
parallel discovery.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manua=
l/make.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>.
</p>
</li><li> Manipulate text by calling functions.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Functions=
">Functions for Transforming Text</a>.

</li><li> Use the =E2=80=98<samp>-o</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>--old=
-file</samp>=E2=80=99
option to pretend a file=E2=80=99s modification-time is old.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Avoiding-=
Compilation">Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files</a>.

</li><li> Conditional execution.

<p>This feature has been implemented numerous times in various versions
of <code>make</code>; it seems a natural extension derived from the feature=
s
of the C preprocessor and similar macro languages and is not a
revolutionary concept.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ma=
nual/make.html#Conditionals">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</a>.
</p>
</li><li> Specify a search path for included makefiles.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include">=
Including Other Makefiles</a>.

</li><li> Specify extra makefiles to read with an environment variable.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKEFILES=
-Variable">The Variable <code>MAKEFILES</code></a>.

</li><li> Strip leading sequences of =E2=80=98<samp>./</samp>=E2=80=99 from=
 file names, so that
<samp>./<var>file</var></samp> and <samp><var>file</var></samp> are conside=
red to be the
same file.

</li><li> Use a special search method for library prerequisites written in =
the
form =E2=80=98<samp>-l<var>name</var></samp>=E2=80=99.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Libraries=
_002fSearch">Directory Search for Link Libraries</a>.

</li><li> Allow suffixes for suffix rules
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Suffix-R=
ules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>) to contain any
characters.  In other versions of <code>make</code>, they must begin with
=E2=80=98<samp>.</samp>=E2=80=99 and not contain any =E2=80=98<samp>/</samp=
>=E2=80=99 characters.

</li><li> Keep track of the current level of <code>make</code> recursion us=
ing the
variable <code>MAKELEVEL</code>.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softwa=
re/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>.

</li><li> Provide any goals given on the command line in the variable
<code>MAKECMDGOALS</code>.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=
e/manual/make.html#Goals">Arguments to Specify the Goals</a>.

</li><li> Specify static pattern rules.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org=
/software/make/manual/make.html#Static-Pattern">Static Pattern Rules</a>.

</li><li> Provide selective <code>vpath</code> search.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory=
-Search">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</a>.

</li><li> Provide computed variable references.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Reference=
">Basics of Variable References</a>.

</li><li> Update makefiles.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/ma=
ke/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>.
System V <code>make</code> has a very, very limited form of this
functionality in that it will check out SCCS files for makefiles.

</li><li> Various new built-in implicit rules.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Catalogue=
-of-Rules">Catalogue of Built-In Rules</a>.

</li><li> Load dynamic objects which can modify the behavior of <code>make<=
/code>.

<span id=3D"index-incompatibilities"></span>
<span id=3D"index-missing-features"></span>
<span id=3D"index-features_002c-missing"></span>

<p>The <code>make</code> programs in various other systems support a few fe=
atures
that are not implemented in GNU <code>make</code>.  The POSIX.2 standard
(<cite>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</cite>) which specifies <code>make</code> =
does not
require any of these features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> A target of the form =E2=80=98<samp><var>file</var>((<var>entry</var>)=
)</samp>=E2=80=99 stands for a member
of archive file <var>file</var>.  The member is chosen, not by name, but by
being an object file which defines the linker symbol <var>entry</var>.

<p>This feature was not put into GNU <code>make</code> because of the
non-modularity of putting knowledge into <code>make</code> of the internal
format of archive file symbol tables.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archive-S=
ymbols">Updating Archive Symbol Directories</a>.
</p>
</li><li> Suffixes (used in suffix rules) that end with the character =E2=
=80=98<samp>~</samp>=E2=80=99
have a special meaning to System V <code>make</code>;
they refer to the SCCS file that corresponds
to the file one would get without the =E2=80=98<samp>~</samp>=E2=80=99.  Fo=
r example, the
suffix rule =E2=80=98<samp>.c~.o</samp>=E2=80=99 would make the file <samp>=
<var>n</var>.o</samp> from
the SCCS file <samp>s.<var>n</var>.c</samp>.  For complete coverage, a whol=
e
series of such suffix rules is required.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Suffix-Ru=
les">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>.

<p>In GNU <code>make</code>, this entire series of cases is handled by two
pattern rules for extraction from SCCS, in combination with the
general feature of rule chaining.
See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Chained-R=
ules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.
</p>
</li><li> In System V and 4.3 BSD <code>make</code>, files found by <code>V=
PATH</code>
search (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#D=
irectory-Search">Searching Directories for
Prerequisites</a>) have their names changed inside recipes.  We feel it
is much cleaner to always use automatic variables and thus make this
feature unnecessary.

</li><li> In some Unix <code>make</code>s, the automatic variable <code>$*<=
/code> appearing in
the prerequisites of a rule has the amazingly strange =E2=80=9Cfeature=E2=
=80=9D of
expanding to the full name of the <em>target of that rule</em>.  We cannot
imagine what went on in the minds of Unix <code>make</code> developers to d=
o
this; it is utterly inconsistent with the normal definition of <code>$*</co=
de>.
<span id=3D"index-_002a-_0028automatic-variable_0029_002c-unsupported-bizar=
re-usage"></span>

</li><li> In some Unix <code>make</code>s, implicit rule search (see <a hre=
f=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rules">Usi=
ng Implicit Rules</a>) is apparently done for <em>all</em>
targets, not just those without recipes.  This means you can
do:

<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o:
        cc -c foo.c
</pre></div>

<p>and Unix <code>make</code> will intuit that <samp>foo.o</samp> depends o=
n
<samp>foo.c</samp>.
</p>
<p>We feel that such usage is broken.  The prerequisite properties of
<code>make</code> are well-defined (for GNU <code>make</code>, at least),
and doing such a thing simply does not fit the model.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>make</code> does not include any built-in implicit rule=
s for
compiling or preprocessing EFL programs.  If we hear of anyone who is
using EFL, we will gladly add them.

</li><li> It appears that in SVR4 <code>make</code>, a suffix rule can be s=
pecified
with no recipe, and it is treated as if it had an empty recipe
(see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Re=
cipes">Using Empty Recipes</a>).  For example:

<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.c.a:
</pre></div>

<p>will override the built-in <samp>.c.a</samp> suffix rule.
</p>
<p>We feel that it is cleaner for a rule without a recipe to always simply
add to the prerequisite list for the target.  The above example can be
easily rewritten to get the desired behavior in GNU <code>make</code>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.c.a: ;
</pre></div>

</li><li> Some versions of <code>make</code> invoke the shell with the =E2=
=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=99 flag,
except under =E2=80=98<samp>-k</samp>=E2=80=99 (see <a href=3D"https://www.=
gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Testing">Testing the Compilation of =
a
Program</a>).  The =E2=80=98<samp>-e</samp>=E2=80=99 flag tells the shell t=
o exit as soon as any
program it runs returns a nonzero status.  We feel it is cleaner to
write each line of the recipe to stand on its own and not require this
special treatment.

<span id=3D"General-Conventions-for-Makefiles"></span><h3 class=3D"section"=
>16.1 General Conventions for Makefiles</h3>

<p>Every Makefile should contain this line:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">SHELL =3D /bin/sh
</pre></div>

<p>to avoid trouble on systems where the <code>SHELL</code> variable might =
be
inherited from the environment.  (This is never a problem with GNU
<code>make</code>.)
</p>
<p>Different <code>make</code> programs have incompatible suffix lists and
implicit rules, and this sometimes creates confusion or misbehavior.  So
it is a good idea to set the suffix list explicitly using only the
suffixes you need in the particular Makefile, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">.SUFFIXES:
.SUFFIXES: .c .o
</pre></div>

<p>The first line clears out the suffix list, the second introduces all
suffixes which may be subject to implicit rules in this Makefile.
</p>
<p>Don=E2=80=99t assume that <samp>.</samp> is in the path for command exec=
ution.  When
you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the
make, please make sure that it uses <samp>./</samp> if the program is built=
 as
part of the make or <samp>$(srcdir)/</samp> if the file is an unchanging pa=
rt
of the source code.  Without one of these prefixes, the current search
path is used.
</p>
<p>The distinction between <samp>./</samp> (the <em>build directory</em>) a=
nd
<samp>$(srcdir)/</samp> (the <em>source directory</em>) is important becaus=
e
users can build in a separate directory using the =E2=80=98<samp>--srcdir</=
samp>=E2=80=99 option
to <samp>configure</samp>.  A rule of the form:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -f sedscript foo.man &gt; foo.1
</pre></div>

<p>will fail when the build directory is not the source directory, because
<samp>foo.man</samp> and <samp>sedscript</samp> are in the source directory=
.
</p>
<p>When using GNU <code>make</code>, relying on =E2=80=98<samp>VPATH</samp>=
=E2=80=99 to find the source
file will work in the case where there is a single dependency file,
since the <code>make</code> automatic variable =E2=80=98<samp>$&lt;</samp>=
=E2=80=99 will represent the
source file wherever it is.  (Many versions of <code>make</code> set =E2=80=
=98<samp>$&lt;</samp>=E2=80=99
only in implicit rules.)  A Makefile target like
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o : bar.c
        $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c bar.c -o foo.o
</pre></div>

<p>should instead be written as
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.o : bar.c
        $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@
</pre></div>

<p>in order to allow =E2=80=98<samp>VPATH</samp>=E2=80=99 to work correctly=
.  When the target has
multiple dependencies, using an explicit =E2=80=98<samp>$(srcdir)</samp>=E2=
=80=99 is the easiest
way to make the rule work well.  For example, the target above for
<samp>foo.1</samp> is best written as:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -f $(srcdir)/sedscript $(srcdir)/foo.man &gt; $@
</pre></div>

<p>GNU distributions usually contain some files which are not source
files=E2=80=94for example, Info files, and the output from Autoconf, Automa=
ke,
Bison or Flex.  Since these files normally appear in the source
directory, they should always appear in the source directory, not in the
build directory.  So Makefile rules to update them should put the
updated files in the source directory.
</p>
<p>However, if a file does not appear in the distribution, then the
Makefile should not put it in the source directory, because building a
program in ordinary circumstances should not modify the source directory
in any way.
</p>
<p>Try to make the build and installation targets, at least (and all their
subtargets) work correctly with a parallel <code>make</code>.

<code>configure</code>) to run under <code>sh</code> (both the traditional =
Bourne
shell and the <small>POSIX</small> shell), not <code>csh</code>.  Don=E2=80=
=99t use any
special features of <code>ksh</code> or <code>bash</code>, or <small>POSIX<=
/small> features
not widely supported in traditional Bourne <code>sh</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>configure</code> script and the Makefile rules for building an=
d
installation should not use any utilities directly except these:
</p>

<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">awk cat cmp cp diff echo expr false grep install-inf=
o ln ls
mkdir mv printf pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch tr true
</pre></div>

<p>Compression programs such as <code>gzip</code> can be used in the
<code>dist</code> rule.
</p>
<p>Generally, stick to the widely-supported (usually
<small>POSIX</small>-specified) options and features of these programs.  Fo=
r
example, don=E2=80=99t use =E2=80=98<samp>mkdir -p</samp>=E2=80=99, conveni=
ent as it may be, because a
few systems don=E2=80=99t support it at all and with others, it is not safe
for parallel execution.  For a list of known incompatibilities, see
<a data-manual=3D"autoconf" href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/m=
anual/autoconf.html#Portable-Shell">Portable Shell Programming</a> in <cite=
>Autoconf</cite>.
</p>

<p>It is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles, since a
few file systems don=E2=80=99t support them.
</p>
<p>The Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers
and related programs, but should do so via <code>make</code> variables so t=
hat the
user can substitute alternatives.  Here are some of the programs we
mean:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">ar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex
make makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc
</pre></div>

<p>Use the following <code>make</code> variables to run those programs:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(AR) $(BISON) $(CC) $(FLEX) $(INSTALL) $(LD) $(LDCO=
NFIG) $(LEX)
$(MAKE) $(MAKEINFO) $(RANLIB) $(TEXI2DVI) $(YACC)
</pre></div>

<p>When you use <code>ranlib</code> or <code>ldconfig</code>, you should ma=
ke sure
nothing bad happens if the system does not have the program in question.
Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before
the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean
a problem.  (The Autoconf =E2=80=98<samp>AC_PROG_RANLIB</samp>=E2=80=99 mac=
ro can help with
this.)
</p>
<p>If you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for systems
that don=E2=80=99t have symbolic links.
</p>
<p>Additional utilities that can be used via Make variables are:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">chgrp chmod chown mknod
</pre></div>

<p>It is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts)
intended only for particular systems where you know those utilities
exist.

<span id=3D"Variables-for-Specifying-Commands"></span><h3 class=3D"section"=
>16.3 Variables for Specifying Commands</h3>

<p>Makefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands, opti=
ons,
and so on.
</p>
<p>In particular, you should run most utility programs via variables.
Thus, if you use Bison, have a variable named <code>BISON</code> whose defa=
ult
value is set with =E2=80=98<samp>BISON =3D bison</samp>=E2=80=99, and refer=
 to it with
<code>$(BISON)</code> whenever you need to use Bison.
</p>
<p>File management utilities such as <code>ln</code>, <code>rm</code>, <cod=
e>mv</code>, and
so on, need not be referred to through variables in this way, since users
don=E2=80=99t need to replace them with other programs.
</p>
<p>Each program-name variable should come with an options variable that is
used to supply options to the program.  Append =E2=80=98<samp>FLAGS</samp>=
=E2=80=99 to the
program-name variable name to get the options variable name=E2=80=94for
example, <code>BISONFLAGS</code>.  (The names <code>CFLAGS</code> for the C
compiler, <code>YFLAGS</code> for yacc, and <code>LFLAGS</code> for lex, ar=
e
exceptions to this rule, but we keep them because they are standard.)
Use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> in any compilation command that runs the
preprocessor, and use <code>LDFLAGS</code> in any compilation command that
does linking as well as in any direct use of <code>ld</code>.
</p>
<p>If there are C compiler options that <em>must</em> be used for proper
compilation of certain files, do not include them in <code>CFLAGS</code>.
Users expect to be able to specify <code>CFLAGS</code> freely themselves.
Instead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler
independently of <code>CFLAGS</code>, by writing them explicitly in the
compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">CFLAGS =3D -g
ALL_CFLAGS =3D -I. $(CFLAGS)
.c.o:
        $(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>Do include the =E2=80=98<samp>-g</samp>=E2=80=99 option in <code>CFLAGS<=
/code>, because that is not
<em>required</em> for proper compilation.  You can consider it a default
that is only recommended.  If the package is set up so that it is
compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include =E2=80=98<samp=
>-O</samp>=E2=80=99
in the default value of <code>CFLAGS</code> as well.
</p>
<p>Put <code>CFLAGS</code> last in the compilation command, after other var=
iables
containing compiler options, so the user can use <code>CFLAGS</code> to
override the others.
</p>
<p><code>CFLAGS</code> should be used in every invocation of the C compiler=
,
both those which do compilation and those which do linking.
</p>
<p>Every Makefile should define the variable <code>INSTALL</code>, which is=
 the
basic command for installing a file into the system.
</p>
<p>Every Makefile should also define the variables <code>INSTALL_PROGRAM</c=
ode>
and <code>INSTALL_DATA</code>.  (The default for <code>INSTALL_PROGRAM</cod=
e> should
be <code>$(INSTALL)</code>; the default for <code>INSTALL_DATA</code> shoul=
d be
<code>${INSTALL} -m 644</code>.)  Then it should use those variables as the
commands for actual installation, for executables and non-executables
respectively.  Minimal use of these variables is as follows:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo
$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a
</pre></div>

<p>However, it is preferable to support a <code>DESTDIR</code> prefix on th=
e
target files, as explained in the next section.
</p>
<p>It is acceptable, but not required, to install multiple files in one
command, with the final argument being a directory, as in:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo bar baz $(bindir)
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-DESTDIR"></span>
<span id=3D"index-staged-installs"></span>
<span id=3D"index-installations_002c-staged"></span>

<p><code>DESTDIR</code> is a variable prepended to each installed target fi=
le,
like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/foo
$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(DESTDIR)$(libdir)/libfoo.a
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>DESTDIR</code> variable is specified by the user on the <code>=
make</code>
command line as an absolute file name.  For example:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">make DESTDIR=3D/tmp/stage install
</pre></div>

<p><code>DESTDIR</code> should be supported only in the <code>install*</cod=
e> and
<code>uninstall*</code> targets, as those are the only targets where it is
useful.
</p>
<p>If your installation step would normally install
<samp>/usr/local/bin/foo</samp> and <samp>/usr/local/lib/libfoo.a</samp>, t=
hen an
installation invoked as in the example above would install
<samp>/tmp/stage/usr/local/bin/foo</samp> and
<samp>/tmp/stage/usr/local/lib/libfoo.a</samp> instead.
</p>
<p>Prepending the variable <code>DESTDIR</code> to each target in this way
provides for <em>staged installs</em>, where the installed files are not
placed directly into their expected location but are instead copied
into a temporary location (<code>DESTDIR</code>).  However, installed files
maintain their relative directory structure and any embedded file names
will not be modified.
</p>
<p>You should not set the value of <code>DESTDIR</code> in your <samp>Makef=
ile</samp>
at all; then the files are installed into their expected locations by
default.  Also, specifying <code>DESTDIR</code> should not change the
operation of the software in any way, so its value should not be
included in any file contents.
</p>
<p><code>DESTDIR</code> support is commonly used in package creation.  It i=
s
also helpful to users who want to understand what a given package will
install where, and to allow users who don=E2=80=99t normally have permissio=
ns
to install into protected areas to build and install before gaining
those permissions.  Finally, it can be useful with tools such as
<code>stow</code>, where code is installed in one place but made to appear
to be installed somewhere else using symbolic links or special mount
operations.  So, we strongly recommend GNU packages support
<code>DESTDIR</code>, though it is not an absolute requirement.

<span id=3D"Variables-for-Installation-Directories"></span><h3 class=3D"sec=
tion">16.5 Variables for Installation Directories</h3>

<p>Installation directories should always be named by variables, so it is
easy to install in a nonstandard place.  The standard names for these
variables and the values they should have in GNU packages are
described below.  They are based on a standard file system layout;
variants of it are used in GNU/Linux and other modern operating
systems.
</p>
<p>Installers are expected to override these values when calling
<code>make</code> (e.g., <kbd>make prefix=3D/usr install</kbd>) or
<code>configure</code> (e.g., <kbd>configure --prefix=3D/usr</kbd>).  GNU
packages should not try to guess which value should be appropriate for
these variables on the system they are being installed onto: use the
default settings specified here so that all GNU packages behave
identically, allowing the installer to achieve any desired layout.
</p>
<span id=3D"index-directories_002c-creating-installation"></span>
<span id=3D"index-installation-directories_002c-creating"></span>
<p>All installation directories, and their parent directories, should be
created (if necessary) before they are installed into.
</p>
<p>These first two variables set the root for the installation.  All the
other installation directories should be subdirectories of one of
these two, and nothing should be directly installed into these two
directories.

</dl>

<p>Data files used by the program during its execution are divided into
categories in two ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Some files are normally modified by programs; others are never normall=
y
modified (though users may edit some of these).

</li><li> Some files are architecture-independent and can be shared by all
machines at a site; some are architecture-dependent and can be shared
only by machines of the same kind and operating system; others may never
be shared between two machines.
</li></ul>

<p>This makes for six different possibilities.  However, we want to
discourage the use of architecture-dependent files, aside from object
files and libraries.  It is much cleaner to make other data files
architecture-independent, and it is generally not hard.
</p>
<p>Here are the variables Makefiles should use to specify directories
to put these various kinds of files in:

<dl compact=3D"compact">

<p>Most compilers other than GCC do not look for header files in directory

s
only useful with GCC.  Sometimes this is not a problem because some
libraries are only really intended to work with GCC.  But some libraries
are intended to work with other compilers.  They should install their
header files in two places, one specified by <code>includedir</code> and on=

specified by <code>oldincludedir</code>.

<p>The Makefile commands should check whether the value of

</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"># Common prefix for installation directories.
# NOTE: This directory must exist when you start the install.
prefix =3D /usr/local
datarootdir =3D $(prefix)/share
datadir =3D $(datarootdir)
exec_prefix =3D $(prefix)
# Where to put the executable for the command 'gcc'.
bindir =3D $(exec_prefix)/bin
# Where to put the directories used by the compiler.
libexecdir =3D $(exec_prefix)/libexec
# Where to put the Info files.
infodir =3D $(datarootdir)/info
</pre></div>

<p>If your program installs a large number of files into one of the
standard user-specified directories, it might be useful to group them
into a subdirectory particular to that program.  If you do this, you
should write the <code>install</code> rule to create these subdirectories.
</p>
<p>Do not expect the user to include the subdirectory name in the value of
any of the variables listed above.  The idea of having a uniform set of
variable names for installation directories is to enable the user to
specify the exact same values for several different GNU packages.  In
order for this to be useful, all the packages must be designed so that
they will work sensibly when the user does so.
</p>
<p>At times, not all of these variables may be implemented in the current
release of Autoconf and/or Automake; but as of Autoconf&nbsp;2.60, we
believe all of them are.  When any are missing, the descriptions here
serve as specifications for what Autoconf will implement.  As a
programmer, you can either use a development version of Autoconf or
avoid using these variables until a stable release is made which
supports them.

<span id=3D"Standard-Targets-for-Users"></span><h3 class=3D"section">16.6 S=
tandard Targets for Users</h3>

<p>All GNU programs should have the following targets in their Makefiles:
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>all</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Compile the entire program.  This should be the default target.  Thi=
s
target need not rebuild any documentation files; Info files should
normally be included in the distribution, and DVI (and other
documentation format) files should be made only when explicitly asked
for.
</p>
<p>By default, the Make rules should compile and link with =E2=80=98<samp>-=
g</samp>=E2=80=99, so
that executable programs have debugging symbols.  Otherwise, you are
essentially helpless in the face of a crash, and it is often far from
easy to reproduce with a fresh build.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>install</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Compile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on t=
o
the file names where they should reside for actual use.  If there is a
simple test to verify that a program is properly installed, this target
should run that test.
</p>
<p>Do not strip executables when installing them.  This helps eventual
debugging that may be needed later, and nowadays disk space is cheap
and dynamic loaders typically ensure debug sections are not loaded during
normal execution.  Users that need stripped binaries may invoke the
<code>install-strip</code> target to do that.
</p>
<p>If possible, write the <code>install</code> target rule so that it does =
not
modify anything in the directory where the program was built, provided
=E2=80=98<samp>make all</samp>=E2=80=99 has just been done.  This is conven=
ient for building the
program under one user name and installing it under another.
</p>
<p>The commands should create all the directories in which files are to be
installed, if they don=E2=80=99t already exist.  This includes the director=
ies
specified as the values of the variables <code>prefix</code> and
<code>exec_prefix</code>, as well as all subdirectories that are needed.
One way to do this is by means of an <code>installdirs</code> target
as described below.
</p>
<p>Use =E2=80=98<samp>-</samp>=E2=80=99 before any command for installing a=
 man page, so that
<code>make</code> will ignore any errors.  This is in case there are system=
s
that don=E2=80=99t have the Unix man page documentation system installed.
</p>
<p>The way to install Info files is to copy them into <samp>$(infodir)</sam=
p>
with <code>$(INSTALL_DATA)</code> (see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/softw=
are/make/manual/make.html#Command-Variables">Variables for Specifying Comma=
nds</a>), and then run
the <code>install-info</code> program if it is present.  <code>install-info=
</code>
is a program that edits the Info <samp>dir</samp> file to add or update the
menu entry for the given Info file; it is part of the Texinfo package.
</p>
<p>Here is a sample rule to install an Info file that also tries to
handle some additional situations, such as <code>install-info</code> not
being present.
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">do-install-info: foo.info installdirs
        $(NORMAL_INSTALL)
# Prefer an info file in . to one in srcdir.
        if test -f foo.info; then d=3D.; \
         else d=3D"$(srcdir)"; fi; \
        $(INSTALL_DATA) $$d/foo.info \
          "$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info"
# Run install-info only if it exists.
# Use 'if' instead of just prepending '-' to the
# line so we notice real errors from install-info.
# Use '$(SHELL) -c' because some shells do not
# fail gracefully when there is an unknown command.
        $(POST_INSTALL)
        if $(SHELL) -c 'install-info --version' \
           &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then \
          install-info --dir-file=3D"$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/dir" \
                       "$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info"; \
        else true; fi
</pre></div>

<p>When writing the <code>install</code> target, you must classify all the
commands into three categories: normal ones, <em>pre-installation</em>
commands and <em>post-installation</em> commands.  See <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Install-Command-Categories">Insta=
ll Command Categories</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>install-html</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>install-dvi</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>

<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>install-ps</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>These targets install documentation in formats other than Info;
they=E2=80=99re intended to be called explicitly by the person installing t=
he
package, if that format is desired.  GNU prefers Info files, so these
must be installed by the <code>install</code> target.
</p>
<p>When you have many documentation files to install, we recommend that
you avoid collisions and clutter by arranging for these targets to
install in subdirectories of the appropriate installation directory,
such as <code>htmldir</code>.  As one example, if your package has multiple
manuals, and you wish to install HTML documentation with many files
(such as the =E2=80=9Csplit=E2=80=9D mode output by <code>makeinfo --html</=
code>), you=E2=80=99ll
certainly want to use subdirectories, or two nodes with the same name
in different manuals will overwrite each other.
</p>
<p>Please make these <code>install-<var>format</var></code> targets invoke =
the
commands for the <var>format</var> target, for example, by making
<var>format</var> a dependency.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>uninstall</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Delete all the installed files=E2=80=94the copies that the =E2=80=98=
<samp>install</samp>=E2=80=99
and =E2=80=98<samp>install-*</samp>=E2=80=99 targets create.
</p>
<p>This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done,
only the directories where files are installed.
</p>
<p>The uninstallation commands are divided into three categories, just like
the installation commands.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=
e/manual/make.html#Install-Command-Categories">Install Command Categories</=
a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>install-strip</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Like <code>install</code>, but strip the executable files while inst=
alling
them.  In simple cases, this target can use the <code>install</code> target=
 in
a simple way:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">install-strip:
        $(MAKE) INSTALL_PROGRAM=3D'$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) -s' \
                install
</pre></div>

<p>But if the package installs scripts as well as real executables, the
<code>install-strip</code> target can=E2=80=99t just refer to the <code>ins=
tall</code>
target; it has to strip the executables but not the scripts.
</p>
<p><code>install-strip</code> should not strip the executables in the build
directory which are being copied for installation.  It should only strip
the copies that are installed.
</p>
<p>Normally we do not recommend stripping an executable unless you are sure
the program has no bugs.  However, it can be reasonable to install a
stripped executable for actual execution while saving the unstripped
executable elsewhere in case there is a bug.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Delete all files in the current directory that are normally created =

<dd><p>Delete all files in the current directory (or created by this

you have unpacked the source and built the program without creating
any other files, =E2=80=98<samp>make distclean</samp>=E2=80=99 should leave=
 only the files
that were in the distribution.  However, there is no need to delete

</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>mostlyclean</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Like =E2=80=98<samp>clean</samp>=E2=80=99, but may refrain from dele=
ting a few files that people
normally don=E2=80=99t want to recompile.  For example, the =E2=80=98<samp>=
mostlyclean</samp>=E2=80=99
target for GCC does not delete <samp>libgcc.a</samp>, because recompiling i=
t
is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>maintainer-clean</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Delete almost everything that can be reconstructed with this Makefil=
e.
This typically includes everything deleted by <code>distclean</code>, plus
more: C source files produced by Bison, tags tables, Info files, and
so on.
</p>
<p>The reason we say =E2=80=9Calmost everything=E2=80=9D is that running th=
e command
=E2=80=98<samp>make maintainer-clean</samp>=E2=80=99 should not delete <sam=
p>configure</samp> even
if <samp>configure</samp> can be remade using a rule in the Makefile.  More
generally, =E2=80=98<samp>make maintainer-clean</samp>=E2=80=99 should not =
delete anything
that needs to exist in order to run <samp>configure</samp> and then begin t=
o
build the program.  Also, there is no need to delete parent
directories that were created with =E2=80=98<samp>mkdir -p</samp>=E2=80=99,=
 since they could
have existed anyway.  These are the only exceptions;
<code>maintainer-clean</code> should delete everything else that can be
rebuilt.
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=98<samp>maintainer-clean</samp>=E2=80=99 target is intended t=
o be used by a maintainer of
the package, not by ordinary users.  You may need special tools to
reconstruct some of the files that =E2=80=98<samp>make maintainer-clean</sa=
mp>=E2=80=99 deletes.
Since these files are normally included in the distribution, we don=E2=80=
=99t
take care to make them easy to reconstruct.  If you find you need to
unpack the full distribution again, don=E2=80=99t blame us.
</p>
<p>To help make users aware of this, the commands for the special
<code>maintainer-clean</code> target should start with these two:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">@echo 'This command is intended for maintainers to u=
se; it'
@echo 'deletes files that may need special tools to rebuild.'

foo.info: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
        $(MAKEINFO) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
</pre></div>

<p>You must define the variable <code>MAKEINFO</code> in the Makefile.  It =
should
run the <code>makeinfo</code> program, which is part of the Texinfo
distribution.
</p>
<p>Normally a GNU distribution comes with Info files, and that means the
Info files are present in the source directory.  Therefore, the Make
rule for an info file should update it in the source directory.  When
users build the package, ordinarily Make will not update the Info files
because they will already be up to date.

<dd><p>Generate documentation files in the given format.  These targets
should always exist, but any or all can be a no-op if the given output
format cannot be generated.  These targets should not be dependencies
of the <code>all</code> target; the user must manually invoke them.
</p>
<p>Here=E2=80=99s an example rule for generating DVI files from Texinfo:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">dvi: foo.dvi

foo.dvi: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
        $(TEXI2DVI) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
</pre></div>

<p>You must define the variable <code>TEXI2DVI</code> in the Makefile.  It
should run the program <code>texi2dvi</code>, which is part of the Texinfo
distribution.  (<code>texi2dvi</code> uses TeX to do the real work of
formatting. TeX is not distributed with Texinfo.)  Alternatively,
write only the dependencies, and allow GNU <code>make</code> to provide the
command.
</p>
<p>Here=E2=80=99s another example, this one for generating HTML from Texinf=
o:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">html: foo.html

foo.html: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
        $(TEXI2HTML) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
</pre></div>

<p>Again, you would define the variable <code>TEXI2HTML</code> in the Makef=
ile;
for example, it might run <code>makeinfo --no-split --html</code>
(<code>makeinfo</code> is part of the Texinfo distribution).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>dist</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>Create a distribution tar file for this program.  The tar file shoul=
d be
set up so that the file names in the tar file start with a subdirectory
name which is the name of the package it is a distribution for.  This
name can include the version number.
</p>
<p>For example, the distribution tar file of GCC version 1.40 unpacks into
a subdirectory named <samp>gcc-1.40</samp>.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to create a subdirectory appropriately
named, use <code>ln</code> or <code>cp</code> to install the proper files i=
n it, and
then <code>tar</code> that subdirectory.
</p>
<p>Compress the tar file with <code>gzip</code>.  For example, the actual
distribution file for GCC version 1.40 is called <samp>gcc-1.40.tar.gz</sam=
p>.
It is ok to support other free compression formats as well.
</p>
<p>The <code>dist</code> target should explicitly depend on all non-source =
files
that are in the distribution, to make sure they are up to date in the
distribution.

<dd><p>It=E2=80=99s useful to add a target named =E2=80=98<samp>installdirs=
</samp>=E2=80=99 to create the
directories where files are installed, and their parent directories.
There is a script called <samp>mkinstalldirs</samp> which is convenient for
this; you can find it in the Gnulib package.
You can use a rule like this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"># Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bin=
dir))
# actually exist by making them if necessary.
installdirs: mkinstalldirs
        $(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs $(bindir) $(datadir) \
                                $(libdir) $(infodir) \
                                $(mandir)
</pre></div>

<p>or, if you wish to support <code>DESTDIR</code> (strongly encouraged),
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example"># Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bin=
dir))
# actually exist by making them if necessary.
installdirs: mkinstalldirs
        $(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs \
            $(DESTDIR)$(bindir) $(DESTDIR)$(datadir) \
            $(DESTDIR)$(libdir) $(DESTDIR)$(infodir) \
            $(DESTDIR)$(mandir)
</pre></div>

<p>This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done.
It should do nothing but create installation directories.

 Install Command Categories</h3>

<span id=3D"index-pre_002dinstallation-commands"></span>
<span id=3D"index-post_002dinstallation-commands"></span>
<p>When writing the <code>install</code> target, you must classify all the
commands into three categories: normal ones, <em>pre-installation</em>
commands and <em>post-installation</em> commands.
</p>
<p>Normal commands move files into their proper places, and set their
modes.  They may not alter any files except the ones that come entirely
from the package they belong to.
</p>
<p>Pre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other files;
in particular, they can edit global configuration files or data bases.
</p>
<p>Pre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal
commands, and post-installation commands are typically run after the
normal commands.
</p>
<p>The most common use for a post-installation command is to run
<code>install-info</code>.  This cannot be done with a normal command, sinc=
e
it alters a file (the Info directory) which does not come entirely and
solely from the package being installed.  It is a post-installation
command because it needs to be done after the normal command which
installs the package=E2=80=99s Info files.
</p>
<p>Most programs don=E2=80=99t need any pre-installation commands, but we h=
ave the
feature just in case it is needed.
</p>
<p>To classify the commands in the <code>install</code> rule into these thr=
ee
categories, insert <em>category lines</em> among them.  A category line
specifies the category for the commands that follow.
</p>
<p>A category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make
variable, plus an optional comment at the end.  There are three
variables you can use, one for each category; the variable name
specifies the category.  Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution
because these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you
<em>should not</em> define them in the makefile).
</p>
<p>Here are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that
explains what it means:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">        $(PRE_INSTALL)     # <span class=3D"roman">P=
re-install commands follow.</span>
        $(POST_INSTALL)    # <span class=3D"roman">Post-install commands fo=
llow.</span>
        $(NORMAL_INSTALL)  # <span class=3D"roman">Normal commands follow.<=
/span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you don=E2=80=99t use a category line at the beginning of the <code>i=
nstall</code>
rule, all the commands are classified as normal until the first category
line.  If you don=E2=80=99t use any category lines, all the commands are
classified as normal.
</p>
<p>These are the category lines for <code>uninstall</code>:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">        $(PRE_UNINSTALL)     # <span class=3D"roman"=
>Pre-uninstall commands follow.</span>
        $(POST_UNINSTALL)    # <span class=3D"roman">Post-uninstall command=
s follow.</span>
        $(NORMAL_UNINSTALL)  # <span class=3D"roman">Normal commands follow=
.</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Typically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries
from the Info directory.
</p>
<p>If the <code>install</code> or <code>uninstall</code> target has any dep=
endencies
which act as subroutines of installation, then you should start
<em>each</em> dependency=E2=80=99s commands with a category line, and start=
 the
main target=E2=80=99s commands with a category line also.  This way, you ca=
n
ensure that each command is placed in the right category regardless of
which of the dependencies actually run.
</p>
<p>Pre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any
programs except for these:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">[ basename bash cat chgrp chmod chown cmp cp dd diff=
 echo
expand expr false find getopt grep gunzip gzip
hostname install install-info kill ldconfig ln ls md5sum
mkdir mkfifo mknod mv printenv pwd rm rmdir sed sort tee
test touch true uname xargs yes
</pre></div>

<span id=3D"index-binary-packages"></span>
<p>The reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the sake
of making binary packages.  Typically a binary package contains all the
executables and other files that need to be installed, and has its own
method of installing them=E2=80=94so it does not need to run the normal
installation commands.  But installing the binary package does need to
execute the pre-installation and post-installation commands.
</p>
<p>Programs to build binary packages work by extracting the
pre-installation and post-installation commands.  Here is one way of
extracting the pre-installation commands (the <samp>-s</samp> option to
<code>make</code> is needed to silence messages about entering
subdirectories):
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">make -s -n install -o all \
      PRE_INSTALL=3Dpre-install \
      POST_INSTALL=3Dpost-install \
      NORMAL_INSTALL=3Dnormal-install \
  | gawk -f pre-install.awk
</pre></div>

<p>where the file <samp>pre-install.awk</samp> could contain this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">$0 ~ /^(normal-install|post-install)[ \t]*$/ {on =3D=
 0}
on {print $0}
$0 ~ /^pre-install[ \t]*$/ {on =3D 1}
</pre></div>

x B Errors Generated by Make</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the more common errors you might see generated by
<code>make</code>, and some information about what they mean and how to fix
them.
</p>
<p>Sometimes <code>make</code> errors are not fatal, especially in the pres=
ence
of a <code>-</code> prefix on a recipe line, or the <code>-k</code> command=
 line
option.  Errors that are fatal are prefixed with the string
<code>***</code>.
</p>
<p>Error messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program
(usually =E2=80=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99), or, if the error is found in=
 a makefile, the name
of the file and line number containing the problem.
</p>
<p>In the table below, these common prefixes are left off.
</p>
<dl compact=3D"compact">
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>[<var>foo</var>] Error <var>NN</var></samp>=E2=80=
=99</span></dt>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>[<var>foo</var>] <var>signal description</var></sa=
mp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>These errors are not really <code>make</code> errors at all.  They m=
ean that a
program that <code>make</code> invoked as part of a recipe returned a
non-0 error code (=E2=80=98<samp>Error <var>NN</var></samp>=E2=80=99), whic=
h <code>make</code> interprets
as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a
signal of some type).  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/man=
ual/make.html#Errors">Errors in Recipes</a>.
</p>
<p>If no <code>***</code> is attached to the message, then the sub-process =
failed
but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the <code>-</code> special
character, so <code>make</code> ignored the error.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>missing separator.  Stop.</samp>=E2=80=99</span></=
dt>
<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 s=
paces?).  Stop.</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>This means that <code>make</code> could not understand much of anyth=
ing
about the makefile line it just read.  GNU <code>make</code> looks for
various separators (<code>:</code>, <code>=3D</code>, recipe prefix charact=
ers,
etc.) to indicate what kind of line it=E2=80=99s parsing.  This message mea=
ns
it couldn=E2=80=99t find a valid one.
</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or
perhaps your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows
editors) have attempted to indent your recipe lines with spaces
instead of a tab character.  In this case, <code>make</code> will use the
second form of the error above.  Remember that every line in the
recipe must begin with a tab character (unless you set
<code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code>; see <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/mak=
e/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Special Variables</a>).  Eight =
spaces do not
count.  See <a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#R=
ule-Syntax">Rule Syntax</a>.

<dt><span>=E2=80=98<samp>missing rule before recipe.  Stop.</samp>=E2=80=99=
</span></dt>
<dd><p>This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a
recipe: it begins with a recipe prefix character and doesn=E2=80=99t appear=
 to
be a legal <code>make</code> directive (such as a variable assignment).
Recipes must always be associated with a target.
</p>
<p>The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first
non-whitespace character; <code>make</code> interprets this to mean you lef=
t
out the "target: prerequisite" section of a rule.  See <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax">Rule Syntax</a>.

 `<var>yyy</var>'.</samp>=E2=80=99</span></dt>
<dd><p>This means that <code>make</code> decided it needed to build a targe=
t, but
then couldn=E2=80=99t find any instructions in the makefile on how to do th=
at,
either explicit or implicit (including in the default rules database).
</p>
<p>If you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to your
makefile describing how that target can be built.  Other possible
sources of this problem are typos in the makefile (if that file name is
wrong) or a corrupted source tree (if that file is not supposed to be
built, but rather only a prerequisite).

x C Complex Makefile Example</h2>

<p>Here is the makefile for the GNU <code>tar</code> program.  This is a
moderately complex makefile.  The first line uses a <code>#!</code> setting
to allow the makefile to be executed directly.
</p>
<p>Because it is the first target, the default goal is =E2=80=98<samp>all</=
samp>=E2=80=99.  An
interesting feature of this makefile is that <samp>testpad.h</samp> is a
source file automatically created by the <code>testpad</code> program,
itself compiled from <samp>testpad.c</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you type =E2=80=98<samp>make</samp>=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98<samp>make a=
ll</samp>=E2=80=99, then <code>make</code> creates
the <samp>tar</samp> executable, the <samp>rmt</samp> daemon that provides
remote tape access, and the <samp>tar.info</samp> Info file.
</p>
<p>If you type =E2=80=98<samp>make install</samp>=E2=80=99, then <code>make=
</code> not only creates
<samp>tar</samp>, <samp>rmt</samp>, and <samp>tar.info</samp>, but also ins=
talls
them.
</p>
<p>If you type =E2=80=98<samp>make clean</samp>=E2=80=99, then <code>make</=
code> removes the =E2=80=98<samp>.o</samp>=E2=80=99
files, and the <samp>tar</samp>, <samp>rmt</samp>, <samp>testpad</samp>,
<samp>testpad.h</samp>, and <samp>core</samp> files.
</p>
<p>If you type =E2=80=98<samp>make distclean</samp>=E2=80=99, then <code>ma=
ke</code> not only removes
the same files as does =E2=80=98<samp>make clean</samp>=E2=80=99 but also t=
he
<samp>TAGS</samp>, <samp>Makefile</samp>, and <samp>config.status</samp> fi=
les.
(Although it is not evident, this makefile (and
<samp>config.status</samp>) is generated by the user with the
<code>configure</code> program, which is provided in the <code>tar</code>
distribution, but is not shown here.)
</p>
<p>If you type =E2=80=98<samp>make realclean</samp>=E2=80=99, then <code>ma=
ke</code> removes the same
files as does =E2=80=98<samp>make distclean</samp>=E2=80=99 and also remove=
s the Info files
generated from <samp>tar.texinfo</samp>.
</p>
<p>In addition, there are targets <code>shar</code> and <code>dist</code> t=
hat create
distribution kits.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of =E2=80=9Ccopyleft=E2=80=9D, which means that d=
erivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The =E2=80=9CDocument=E2=80=9D, b=
elow,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D.  You accept the licens=
e if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A =E2=80=9CModified Version=E2=80=9D of the Document means any work cont=
aining the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A =E2=80=9CSecondary Section=E2=80=9D is a named appendix or a front-mat=
ter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document=E2=80=99s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=9CInvariant Sections=E2=80=9D are certain Secondary Sections =
whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=9CCover Texts=E2=80=9D are certain short passages of text tha=
t are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A =E2=80=9CTransparent=E2=80=9D copy of the Document means a machine-rea=
dable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not =E2=80=9CTransparent=E2=80=9D is called =E2=80=
=9COpaque=E2=80=9D.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=9CTitle Page=E2=80=9D means, for a printed book, the title pa=
ge itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, =E2=80=9CTitle Page=E2=80=
=9D means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work=E2=80=99s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The =E2=80=9Cpublisher=E2=80=9D means any person or entity that distribu=
tes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section =E2=80=9CEntitled XYZ=E2=80=9D means a named subunit of the Do=
cument whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as =E2=80=9CAcknowledgements=E2=
=80=9D,
=E2=80=9CDedications=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CEndorsements=E2=80=9D, or =E2=80=9C=
History=E2=80=9D.)  To =E2=80=9CPreserve the Title=E2=80=9D
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section =E2=80=9CEntitled XYZ=E2=80=9D according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document=E2=80=99s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose th=
e
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol type=3D"A" start=3D"1">
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entiti=
es
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notic=
e
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Secti=
ons
and required Cover Texts given in the Document=E2=80=99s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled =E2=80=9CHistory=E2=80=9D, Preserve=
 its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled =E2=80=9CHistory=E2=80=9D in the Document, cre=
ate one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the =E2=80=9CHistory=E2=80=9D sect=
ion.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled =E2=80=9CAcknowledgements=E2=80=9D or =
=E2=80=9CDedications=E2=80=9D, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled =E2=80=9CEndorsements=E2=80=9D.  Such=
 a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled =E2=80=9CEndor=
sements=E2=80=9D or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version=E2=80=99s license notice=
.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled =E2=80=9CEndorsements=E2=80=9D, provided =
it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties=E2=80=94for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled =E2=80=9CHist=
ory=E2=80=9D
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
=E2=80=9CHistory=E2=80=9D; likewise combine any sections Entitled =E2=80=9C=
Acknowledgements=E2=80=9D,
and any sections Entitled =E2=80=9CDedications=E2=80=9D.  You must delete a=
ll
sections Entitled =E2=80=9CEndorsements.=E2=80=9D
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an =E2=80=9Caggregate=E2=80=9D if the copyri=
ght
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation=E2=80=99s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document=E2=80=99s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled =E2=80=9CAcknowledgements=E2=80=
=9D,
=E2=80=9CDedications=E2=80=9D, or =E2=80=9CHistory=E2=80=9D, the requiremen=
t (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>=
.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License =E2=80=9Cor any later version=E2=80=9D applies to it, you have the =
option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy=E2=80=99s public statement of acceptance of=
 a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>=E2=80=9CMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site=E2=80=9D (or =E2=80=9CMM=
C Site=E2=80=9D) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
=E2=80=9CMassive Multiauthor Collaboration=E2=80=9D (or =E2=80=9CMMC=E2=80=
=9D) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CCC-BY-SA=E2=80=9D means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share =
Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CIncorporate=E2=80=9D means to publish or republish a Document, =
in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is =E2=80=9Celigible for relicensing=E2=80=9D if it is licensed u=
nder this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<span id=3D"ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></spa=
n><h3 class=3D"heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your document=
s</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</va=
r>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the =E2=80=9Cwith=E2=80=A6Texts.=E2=80=9D line with this:
</p>
<div class=3D"example">
<pre class=3D"example">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list thei=
r titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Te=
xts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<h5><a id=3D"FOOT1" href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#DOCF1">(1)</a></h5>
<p>GNU Make compiled for MS-DOS and MS-Windows behaves as if
<var>prefix</var> has been defined to be the root of the DJGPP tree hierarc=
hy.</p>
<h5><a id=3D"FOOT2" href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#DOCF2">(2)</a></h5>
<p>Some older versions of GNU <code>make</code> did not sort the
results of wildcard expansion.</p>
<h5><a id=3D"FOOT3" href=3D"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.h=
tml#DOCF3">(3)</a></h5>
<p>On
MS-DOS, the value of current working directory is <strong>global</strong>, =
so
changing it <em>will</em> affect the following recipe lines on those
systems.</p>
